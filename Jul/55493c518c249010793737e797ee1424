JOHANNESBURG - A week of rolling violence and looting has delayed social grant payments in parts of KwaZulu-Natal. The unprecedented criminal rampage in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng saw thousands of looters steal and burn their way through neighbourhoods. Among the casualties in the mayhem, were the very offices that the poor relied on for their social grants.

Ntshaveni said that there was only one Sassa office that was targeted in Gauteng - the office in Alexandra. But officials have made alternative arrangements for beneficiaries there. However, in KwaZulu-Natal, Sassa could not pay out grants that were earmarked for payment on Tuesday. Twenty Sassa local offices and 21 post offices in KwaZulu-Natal were vandalised and burned down. These offices are not offering social services and beneficiaries have been advised to use ATMs and shops to access their social grants. Sassa grants that were earmarked to be paid on 20 July have been postponed to a later date. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
