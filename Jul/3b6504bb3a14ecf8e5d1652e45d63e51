JOHANNESBURG - eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda on Wednesday said that people had the constitutional right to call for former President Jacob Zuma to be released but it did not give anyone the right to steal. The police and state security were investigating more than 10 people who were said to be the instigators driving the mass looting and violence in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Violence broke out on Friday when a group of people demanded the release of Zuma, however, opportunists and criminal elements have taken over. People have been ransacking shops, malls, bombing ATMs and clearing out factories and warehouses leaving businesses gutted.

Kaunda said that they were getting interfaith, businesses and traditional leaders on board to speak to communities to unite and rebuild after the violence. “We will be telling people to accept they have done wrong but now stop the looting and burning.” But how will the leaders be able to stop the violence by simply talking to them? The mayor said that people had been calling on him to speak to the national government to release Zuma but Kaunda said that although he could not do that, it was important that those who could, listened. Mopping up operations were underway in some parts of KwaZulu-Natal while authorities assess the extent of the damage to property and businesses.
