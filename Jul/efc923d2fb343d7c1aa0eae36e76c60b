The City of Cape Town's Zahid Badroodien said that municipal health services had also been affected. While there've been no reports of further violence over the past day, police have intensified visibility, along with soldiers in various areas. “The taxi violence in a number of volatile communities has caused the city to assess the security risk to not only our staff but our buildings as well.
