Furthermore, he will be assessed by our medical team in conjunction with the South African health ministry services and this will determine the decision of his incarceration. This assessment is done to determine the risks and needs of the offender,” Lamola said. Lamola said that he would be assessed before a decision was made on how he would be incarcerated. The minister added that Zuma would be eligible for parole when he served a quarter of his 15-month sentence: “In this case, there is no stipulation for the non-parole period. This effectively means that the former president will be eligible for parole once a quarter of his sentence has been served.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
