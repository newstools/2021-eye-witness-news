TOKYO - Moroccan heavyweight boxer Youness Baalla attempted to bite David Nyika's ear during his defeat to the New Zealander at the Tokyo Olympics on Tuesday. The 22-year-old was subsequently disqualified for unsportsmanlike behaviour, although he was already out of the Games anyway following his unanimous-points loss in the round-of-16 bout. A Tokyo 2020 statement called Baalla's actions "intolerable", saying that he "very clearly intended to bite the ear/face of his opponent in the third round of the bout". Footage shows Baalla trying to bite Nyika's right ear as the two boxers hold each other. Nyika, a two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist who has already fought as a professional, said: "He didn't get a full mouthful. "Luckily he had his mouth guard in and I was a bit sweaty. "I was bitten on the chest at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games [2018], but come on man, this is the Olympics."
