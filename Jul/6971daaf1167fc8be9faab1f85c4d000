The cost of all this damage is yet to be determined but is said to be in the billions. As a result, many jobs are now on the line. “So many people are feeling overwhelmed by everything that's going on, you know feeling really scared and fearful. Very anxious but also just really scared as to what to what's going to happen next,” said Sadag director Cassey Chambers on Thursday.

Somewhere safe to stay, something to eat, something to keep them warm. There is so much happening at the moment that they're feeling like they're getting it from all sides,” she said.
