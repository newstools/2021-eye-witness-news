JOHANNESBURG - Government said it doesn’t not believe that the security breach in Transnet's IT infrastructure is related to the recent unrest in the country. This comes as the Road Freight Association's drivers bear the brunt of the impact caused by the cyber-attack on Transnet. The association said following Transnet's disruptions to some of its infrastructure this week the state-owned logistics entity was forced to shut down its systems. This has resulted in manual operations which the association says is creating massive delays and unreliability of the movement of goods. Acting Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said: “The IT breach at Transnet is still regarded as an unrelated event to the unrest. Minister Pravin Gordhan, together with the management of Transnet, met with industry players affected by the disruptions of Transnet operations to explain measures being undertaken to restore operations and prevent future attacks.” Meanwhile, the Road Freight Association has expressed its dismay and grave concern over the apparent cyberattack on Transnet saying was creating massive delays and instability on the movement of goods across all models of transport with the association bearing the brunt of the impact. Road Freight Association's CEO Gavin Kelly said: “The recent cyberattack on Transnet is very worrying given the fact that it has affected our biggest port, which is Durban and has effectively closed that port for any cargo moving through and trucks that are already trying to due to the backlog that has happened due to the unrest.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
