JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that it accepted the ruling by the Randburg Magistrates Court in the incitement case against Ngizwe Mchunu. The NPA lost its bid to keep in custody the alleged instigator of the recent anarchy, which left more than 330 people dead in Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng.

Despite the setback, spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, Phindi Mjondondwane maintains that the State has enough evidence to hold Mchunu accountable. However, the NPA has made it clear that the evidence will only be disclosed when the case goes to trial. Meanwhile, Mchunu's lawyer, Advocate Sthembiso Mdladla, poked holes in the State's evidence which relied solely on video footage that favoured the applicant. Mchunu was arrested earlier this month after he handed himself over to police. The case will return to court on 21 October following further investigations.
