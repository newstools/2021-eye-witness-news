JOHANNESBURG - Rugby World Cup winners South Africa have gone into isolation for a second time in as many weeks after lock Lood de Jager tested positive for coronavirus on Monday. A South African Rugby statement said "Lood de Jager returned a positive outcome in scheduled testing and, because of his close contact with a number of squad members, the entire group has gone into isolation." Last weekend, the 45-strong squad went into isolation at a Johannesburg hotel after winger Sibusiso Nkosi, scrum-half Herschel Jantjies and prop Vincent Koch tested positive for COVID-19. It later emerged that Jantjies' result was a false positive and he came off the bench in a 40-9 win against Georgia last Friday. The countries are due to meet again this Friday in Johannesburg with South Africa preparing for a Test series against the touring British and Irish Lions on three consecutive Saturdays from 24 July.
