CAPE TOWN – The Western Cape transport department has said that associations not affiliated to warring Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) and Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) will be allowed to operate from the Bellville public transport interchange. On Friday MEC Daylin Mitchell announced the closure of the Paarl to Bellville route for at least two months in an attempt to solve the unabated taxi violence between Cata and Codeta.
