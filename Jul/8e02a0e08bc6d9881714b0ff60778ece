JOHANNESBURG – The national health department has announced that there were 14,701 new cases of COVID-19 recorded over the past 24 hours in South Africa. This comes amid concerns that the recent riots in some parts of the country may lead to a surge in new infections, as the country experiences the third wave of the pandemic. The Gauteng health department has said it will open more vaccination sites encouraging eligible residents to come out in their numbers to get their first jabs.
