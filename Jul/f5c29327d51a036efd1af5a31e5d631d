JOHANNESBURG – The health department has said that, due to the violence that gripped Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, its vaccination targets have fallen behind. The department said it had anticipated a weekly vaccination target of over 200,000 but some sites in both provinces had to close to protect the vials. However, the department says it directed the vaccines to increase capacity in other provinces.

The health department's deputy director-general Nicholas Crisp said, “Other provinces have stepped up to the plate and they have been vaccinating as fast as they can. The vaccines that would have gone to KwaZulu-Natal in this period have now been re-directed to other provinces, and when it is stable there, we will all help them again to get them back up to speed.”   Meanwhile, 413 people have died from COVID-19 complications in South Africa during the past 24-hour reporting cycle.
