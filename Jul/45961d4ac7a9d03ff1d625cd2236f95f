DURBAN - Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Monday said that the unrestrained mass gatherings that took place in Nkandla over the past week should be treated as treasonous. Hundreds of people have been flocking to former President Jacob Zuma’s homestead following a scathing court ruling that sentenced him to a 15-month jail term for being in contempt of the Constitutional Court. The apex court agreed on a guilty verdict against Zuma after concluding that he had been given multiple opportunities to co-operate with it but failed to do so.

Mr Zuma’s lawyers let him down and he is now facing the consequences.” Buthelezi said, however, that this does not warrant the flagrant disregard of COVID-19 regulations, describing the scenes from Nkandla as troubling and simply wrong. The elderly statesman said that while he was sympathetic to Zuma, challenges to the state and risking lives through illegal mass gatherings were unacceptable.
