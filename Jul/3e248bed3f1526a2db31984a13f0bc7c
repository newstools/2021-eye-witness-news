JOHANNESBURG - One of the alleged masterminds behind what has been termed as a failed insurrection, Ngizwe Mchunu, is back in the dock on Wednesday at the Randburg Magistrates Court for a formal bail application. The former radio host was arrested earlier this month after he handed himself over to police in KwaZulu-Natal. Law enforcement authorities have identified Mchunu as one of the people behind the deadly and destructive violence that gripped KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Mchunu's supporters said that his case was a political prosecution but they've offered no proof to back up these claims. During his court appearance last week, prosecutors told the Randburg Magistrates Court that Mchunu was a flight risk after he allegedly flew out of Gauteng in a private jet to KwaZulu-Natal to evade arrest.
