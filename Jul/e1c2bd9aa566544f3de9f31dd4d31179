CAPE TOWN - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on Friday said various public sector unions were still mulling a wage offer from government. Parties in the protracted public sector wage negotiations two weeks ago agreed to consider government's latest offer. Government is offering 1,5% salary increase and up to R1,695 in allowances per month.

Of course, we still have some time. However, we will allow some unions who are still doing their calculations some time,” Mugwena said.
