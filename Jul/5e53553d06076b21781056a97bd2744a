CAPE TOWN - Amid concerns of a looming humanitarian crisis in KwaZulu-Natal, some Capetonians are chipping in to help. A Cape Town donations coordinator Jo Voster: "The response has been really incredible, we've been overwhelmed by the number of items received, boxes and boxes already packed up to be distributed on Monday. The non-perishable goods that we're looking for are pasta, flour, baby goods - nappies, baby formula - and there's been such a shortage in Durban - we're also looking for any canned meats." She said that non-perishable goods could be donated at drop-off points in Claremont, Somerset West and Stellenbosch. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
