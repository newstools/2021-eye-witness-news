JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng government on Tuesday said it was pleased that eligible people were enthusiastic to get their COVID-19 jab without having an appointment and said no one would be turned away. Government is trying to increase its pace to get as many as 100,000 people jabbed per day but with that it’s also planning to increase its capacity. Many sites are now open over weekends while a number of drive-through facilities have been set up.

If we turn them away, then we have missed the opportunity to have one person vaccinated.” National government wants to see 35 million people immunised by the end of the year. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said they were increasing their capacity through partnership with the private sector. “They are availing a lot of support material including technology companies that are supporting us while other companies are providing big venues or what we call mass vaccination venues.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
