JOHANNESBURG - The “A” team gave the British and Irish Lions a warm Cape Town welcome with a 17-13 victory on Wednesday evening. South Africa ‘A’ ran in two tries to hand the lions their first defeat of the tour of South Africa led by stand in captain Lukhanyo Am. Despite numerous positive COVID-19 cases in the team over the past two weeks and having to be in isolation for the past seven days, South Africa managed to put in a physical performance, going into halftime with a 17-3 lead. Thanks to tries from Sbu Nkosi and Am – and teammates Willie le Roux and Cheslin Kolbe the architects of those tries. The hosts challenged the Lions at the breakdown with the forwards putting in a big shift. The visitors took advantage of South Africa’s two yellow cards - Marco van Staden and Faf de Klerk - early in the second half with a try from Wyn Jones and two penalty kicks from Owen Farrell, who was named in the team right before kick-off in place of Dan Biggar. The experienced Morne Steyn missed a penalty and an attempted drop goal as the South Africans failed to score in the final half of the game. Kolbe was named Man of the Match.
