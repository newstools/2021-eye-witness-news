He added that the municipality was also trying to prevent rogue and pirate taxis from operating. “The pound is really full. We've got minibus taxis and some private vehicles as well that have been impounded. As a consequence of this enforcement, the vehicle we just found, the driver has no driver's licence, is overloaded by seven passengers, notwithstanding the COVID regulations. The passengers are standing in a vehicle, which is not permitted,” Smith said.
