JOHANNESBURG – With lockdown level 4 regulations set to expire on Monday, the Restaurant Association of South Africa (Rasa) has said the government cannot continue to isolate and prejudice their industry. Rasa says restaurants in the country have been hit hard during the two-week adjusted level 4 lockdown, putting 70% of employees on unpaid layoffs. Their call comes on the backdrop of Saturday’s national coronavirus command council meeting today to discuss the regulations.
