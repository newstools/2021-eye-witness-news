JOHANNESBURG – The South African Weather Service says at least 19 low-temperature records were broken in 24 hours, following icy conditions across the country. A succession of cold fronts had been forecast for the parts of the country this week. This saw temperatures in some areas reach below freezing on Thursday night, which has been dubbed the coldest night in the country this year. Parts of South Africa were covered in snow and icicles this week following bitterly cold conditions.

Forecaster Lulama Pheme said after the sub-zero temperatures in some areas, residents can look forward to some improvements. “The temperatures are still expected to be cold as well as cool over the lowveld, and also more cool conditions along the west coast.
