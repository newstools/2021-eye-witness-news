JOHANNESBURG – Justice Minister Ronald Lamola on Thursday said the decisions of the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday, and the outcome of the Constitutional Court hearing scheduled for Monday would now determine how long former President Jacob Zuma would stay behind bars. Zuma wanted the High Court to suspend his sentence until the Constitutional Court hears and decides his application to rescind his 15-month sentence. Lamola said the department had to wait until the Pietermaritzburg High Court delivered its ruling.
