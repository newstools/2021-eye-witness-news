JOHANNESBURG – As Johannesburg mourns the loss of its mayor, officials have asked people to avoid going to Geoff Makhubo’s family home to pay their last respects. This is because of the current COVID-19 regulations, under the adjusted level 4 lockdown, which does not allow for public gatherings – including gatherings for funerals. The City of Johannesburg mayor passed away from COVID-19-related complications on Friday after he had been in hospital for several days. Makhubo tested positive for the virus late last month. Tributes have been pouring in from all corners, including President Cyril Ramaphosa who described the mayor’s death as a loss to the City of Johannesburg and the province at large.

The City has created online platforms, where people can share their messages of condolences.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
