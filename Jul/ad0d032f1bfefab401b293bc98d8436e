There will be 90 approved vaccination sites in correctional centres across the country targeting more than 140,000 inmates. Some inmates who were first on the queue said they welcomed the opportunity. “As inmates, we live together, there's no real social distancing for us so, you know, any chance that we do have to combat this, or coronavirus you know it's really welcome,” one prisoner said. Taryn Fao was the first female inmate to be immunised and she was over the moon. “I can only say thank you, I've had my jab. I'm feeling fine. So, yeah. Good,” said the excited inmate. Minister Ronald Lamola hoped that they would be able to immunise more than 8,000 officials and prisoners a day. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
