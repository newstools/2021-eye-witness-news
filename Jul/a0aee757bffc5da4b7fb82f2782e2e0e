JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said the estimated damage at schools during two weeks of unrest in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal could be more than R300 million. Motshekga was on Saturday speaking in Pretoria on the state on readiness for the reopening of schools for the third academic term. The education section was one the hardest hit during the weeks of unrest in KZN and Gauteng. While others were busy looting shops and malls others destroyed infrastructure at centres of learning and teaching. In KwaZulu-Natal 137 schools, three education centres and eight circuit offices were targeted. In Gauteng, 11 schools were affected. Motshekga said: “Our ablutions were vandalised, water supplies destroyed even water tanks that were put in schools. Some schools have their electrical wires ripped off.” This is a major setback for the sector already under pressure to provide appropriate infrastructure for schooling. Despite vaccine hesitancy from some teachers and support staff, the Basic Education Department has reported an 89% COVID-19 inoculation success rate since the national roll out of the immunisation campaign in the sector. There have been reports that other employees were not eager to get their jabs for various reasons including religious and medical reasons. In total 582,000 vaccines were allocated to the sector and 517,000 were used. Motshega said she’s encouraged while also calling those who had doubts at the early stages to come forward. “And we still hope that these educators will come forward. They can join the national general vaccination programme which is under way.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
