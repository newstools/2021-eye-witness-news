MITCHELL'S PLAIN - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde rolled up his sleeve for his first dose of the Pfizer jab on Saturday. Winde received his COVID-19 vaccine at Mitchell's Plain Community Health Centre. “Mitchell’s Plain at the moment is one the communities that have the lowest take-up rates for those 50 years and older and I really want to encourage the citizens to do just like I did, get vaccinated and let’s play catch up with some of our other towns,” Winde explained about why he chose to get the jab there. “I look forward to, in six weeks’ time, having my follow-up vaccine so that I am fully protected and I need to make sure that all of us in the Western Cape are fully protected.” #Covid19SA Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde has received the first dose of his COVID-19 vaccine at Mitchells Plain CHC in Cape Town this morning.
