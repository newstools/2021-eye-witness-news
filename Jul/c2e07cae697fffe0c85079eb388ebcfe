JOHANNESBURG - Australian Athletics confirmed that their 63 athletes were in isolation after being in contact with a positive COVID-19 person with the track and field events due to start in less than 24 hours. The measures are precautionary while the team waits to undergo testing after they were identified as having been in close contact with a person who returned a positive result.
