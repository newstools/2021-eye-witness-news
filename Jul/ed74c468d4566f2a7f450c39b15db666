Western Cape Premier Alan Winde said that they would initially kick off with 700 recipients: “Those aged 50 and above are going to be able to make use of the site and we need to make sure that we continue to finish up vaccinating those 60 and above who need their vaccines.” Head of Health Dr Keith Cloete has stressed that, based on the available capacity, they would allow walk-ins at vaccination sites across the province. “We will prioritise people over the age of 60 for the first dose, people over the age of 60 who are now scheduled for the second dose, and people over 50 for the first dose. We will still allow walk-ins at each of our sites, dependent on the capacity, the number of vaccines, available at the site and in the walk-in queues, we still prioritise people over the ages of 50 and 60,” Cloete said. More than 369,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the Western Cape since phase two of the mass rollout was started in May. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
