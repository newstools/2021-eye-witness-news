JOHANNESBURG - Chad le Clos finished fifth in the men’s 200m butterfly final, saying he wanted more. “I worked hard this year, I deserved better than that. It sucks because my mind and my soul deserved better than I put out there,” Le Clos said. The swimmer went on to say: “I felt great. Walked out there looking at everyone feeling excited, like I always do. I wasn’t nervous at all. It's just that the body didn’t work. The body didn’t come back, unfortunately." The 29-year-old also congratulated race winner Kristof Milak, who set a new Olympic record time of 1:51.25.
