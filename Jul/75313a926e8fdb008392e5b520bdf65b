The association said there was a backlog of fruit across the citrus supply chain, causing temporary delays when it came to fruit being exported to key markets. However, the shipping of citrus was not impacted due to the fruit being serviced by private terminals in domestic ports. The association's CEO Justine Chadwick said they were in constant contact with Transnet: “The citrus fruit that is being shipped via great bulk do not make use of Transnet terminals, they use private terminals and it is not impacted by this cyberattack.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
