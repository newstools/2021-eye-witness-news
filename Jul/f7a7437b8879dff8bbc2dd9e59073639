CAPE TOWN - Alun Wyn Jones will captain the British and Irish Lions in the first Test against South Africa at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday after a remarkably quick recovery from a shoulder injury. The Wales lock and the most capped player in the sport's history, who only arrived in South Africa last Tuesday after recovering from the injury will lead a team which contains several surprises. "In my four tours as a Lions coach, this was by far the hardest Test selection I have been involved in," coach Warren Gatland said on Wednesday. Scotland scrum-half Ali Price was selected ahead of Ireland's Conor Murray, who was named tour skipper when Jones was initially ruled out because of injury. Hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, with only six international starts, was preferred to fellow England front-rower Jamie George and Ken Owens of Wales. Jack Conan of Ireland edged out Taulupe Faletau at No. 8 in another selection seemingly based on tour form, with England pair Tom Curry and the towering Courtney Lawes completing the loose forward trio.
