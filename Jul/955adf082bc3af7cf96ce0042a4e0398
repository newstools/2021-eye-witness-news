JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo passed away on Friday after contracting COVID-19. He was hospitalised on Saturday with COVID-19 complications, following a positive test result in late June. After testing positive, the mayor urged the public to do all they could to minimise the spread of the virus. “Joburg is officially in a third wave and residents are urged to take the necessary non-medical precautions. Wear masks, maintain social distance and limit movement in compliance with the regulations.” Acting executive mayor, Eunice Mgcina, confirmed that Makhubo succumbed to COVID-19 on Friday morning. She shared condolences with his friends and family, saying that she'd hoped that the executive mayor would beat the virus and return to work to lead the city as it continued to battle the pandemic that has devastated lives and livelihoods. Makhubo's family has requested privacy and space and mourners were discouraged from gathering at the deceased's home. Geoffrey Makhubo was appointed Joburg mayor in December 2019.
