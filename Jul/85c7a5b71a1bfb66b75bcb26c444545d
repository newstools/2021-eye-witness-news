JOHANNESBURG - A team of specialists assembled by the National Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment will head to KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday to help deal with the impact of a fire at a Durban chemical plant. The UPL warehouse in Cornubia, which housed hundreds of hazardous herbicides, fungicides and pesticides, was targeted last Monday by looters. It took firefighters more than a week to douse the flames and the damage was not confined to the facility.

It's not only marine life that has been threatened but birds have also died. While the KwaZulu-Natal Environmental Affairs Department has started running tests and evaluating the damage to the environment, an additional team of specialists in aquatic systems, epidemiology, waste and pollution as well as oceans and coasts compliance will provide support. “The priority at this stage is to ensure that impacts are mitigated and that containment measures are effective,” said national spokesperson Albi Modise. Beaches in the north of Durban remain closed,  as are nearby businesses. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
