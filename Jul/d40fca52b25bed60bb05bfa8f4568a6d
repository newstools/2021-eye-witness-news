CAPE TOWN – While the national coronavirus command council (NCCC) is scheduled to meet on Sunday, it remains unclear whether stricter lockdown regulations will be extended. As the COVID-19 caseload increased, the President announced an alcohol sales ban and a 9 pm curfew two weeks ago. That adjustment was for 14 days and now, with infections showing no signs of slowing down, there's speculation it could be prolonged. By Friday, the nation's active caseload passed 209,000. Cases continue to show a rapid increase – especially in Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape.
