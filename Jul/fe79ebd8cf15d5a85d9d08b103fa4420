DURBAN – Government authorities in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have said that plans to implement programmes aimed at rebuilding broken community relations in areas affected by civil unrest were now under way. The province was the epicentre of violent looting that resulted in the deaths of over 300 people nationwide. Billions of rands worth of stock and property were also looted and set alight. The province has now declared a state of disaster to seek help from the national government. Racial tensions were reignited in various suburban areas in KZN after some residents put up barricades and checkpoints, effectively impeding the free movement of others, with many of those affected complaining about racial profiling.
