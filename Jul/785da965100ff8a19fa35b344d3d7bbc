Several trucks were torched, warehouses were set alight, shops were looted and roads were cordoned off during this month's anarchy . The South African Association Of Freight Forwarders' chair, Juanita Maree, said that the problem started three years ago with the burning and looting of trucks carrying goods from all over the world. “We need from the government strong leadership and the private sector also needs to take action. But if there’s not strong leadership, we take hands and we work together and we collaborate, and we keep on emphasising the same message that we need this strong logistics infrastructure to sustain localisation,” she said.
