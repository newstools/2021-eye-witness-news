JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 8pm on Monday night. This follows rioting and looting in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal over the last few days, which have resulted in the death of six people, and more than 200 others have been arrested for the public unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The riots initially started as protests by some calling for the release of former President Jacob Zuma from prison in Kwazulu-Natal on Friday and spilled over to parts of Gauteng over the weekend. The army has been deployed in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, while police reinforcements have been called up. It will be the president's second address in 24 hours.
