The ANC in Ekurhuleni has started discussing the implications of having one of their own linked to the widespread looting. Nciza said while the party knows the councillor has been arrested, it cannot confirm why as yet. He said officials in the region are waiting to see how the matter played out, as far as law enforcement is concerned. “If indeed it is true, we’ll have to apply a step-aside rule of the ANC and we’ll have to put him through disciplinary hearing.” Nciza said the party does not want to be accused of targeting any of its members, this as the Democratic Alliance in the region has called for the full might of the law to be used in dealing with the councillor should he be found guilty.
