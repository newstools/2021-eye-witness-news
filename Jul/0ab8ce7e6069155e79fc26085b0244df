CAPE TOWN – Despite numerous calls for calm and promises of a truce, taxi-related violence has continued in Cape Town. In the latest attack on Friday, one man was killed, and another was left wounded in Mfuleni. The gunmen are still at large. The latest taxi-related killing happened mere hours after provincial authorities met with the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata), Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta), the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) organisations, and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula.
