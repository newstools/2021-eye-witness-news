JOHANNESBURG – President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on members of the public in KwaZulu-Natal to respect the rule of law and desist from inflicting damage on the economy. This comes as police in the province deployed more officers and resources to where violent demonstrations have resulted in the destruction of property, including trucks travelling along the N3. Since Thursday, there have been sporadic demonstrations along the N3, N2, and M7, allegedly by people calling for the release of former President Jacob Zuma from prison.

The violence broke out after the former president started serving his 15-month jail term for contempt of the Constitutional Court. The N3 toll concession confirmed that 23 trucks were set alight along the highway, causing a major traffic jam. Spokesperson Tanya Dhoogra said, “Law enforcement is on scene at the moment ensuring that everything is calm and assisting with the clean-up operation which involves all of the various emergency services.” In other parts of KZN, protesters burned tyres and blocked roads.
