In an application filed to the Pietermaritzburg High Court at the weekend, Zuma’s lawyer, Bethuel Thusini, said that the former president wanted to testify in person about why he should be acquitted of corruption charges without standing trial. In the papers, Zuma has repeated claims previously dismissed by the courts. These include that State prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer, was biased against him and that the case had been fabricated by his political enemies.
