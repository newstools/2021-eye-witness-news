DURBAN – Government authorities in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have called for calm and maximum restraint following sporadic protests in various parts of the province on Friday. It’s believed that those behind the demonstrations are against the incarceration of former President Jacob Zuma. Zuma was sentenced to a 15-month jail term after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of being in contempt.
