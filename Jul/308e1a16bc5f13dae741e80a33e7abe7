CAPE TOWN – Politicians and leaders within civil society are on a drive to encourage more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. President Cyril Ramaphosa visited vaccination sites in Gauteng on Thursday, while Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo joined religious leaders in Mitchell's Plain. Residents braved the cold and rain to get their jabs. MEC Mbombo said vaccine hesitancy was high in Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, and she was particularly concerned about people over the age of 60. “In these areas already we have seen hesitancy on the vaccine among the older persons. In Mitchells Plain,  the ones I am worried about are the over 60s.” #VaccineRollOutSA Religious leaders say its important to get on board and encourage people to be vaccinated.

It’s also your constitutional right to get this vaccine  so that you can be in good standing when this virus attacks you.” Reverend Errol Van Der Ross said people offer a range of reasons why they do not want to be vaccinated, and that's why important for religious leaders to lead by example and present the facts. “People talk about it being the mark of the beast and think that there is some way that the government will track and all kinds of things but there is no, absolutely no conclusive evidence of that.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
