CAPE TOWN - Eskom's announced stage two load shedding between 4 pm and 9 pm for Thursday. Earlier the utility warned load shedding was a possibility and might be implemented at short notice. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the grid was severely constrained, with more than 13,000 megawatts lost due to breakdowns and another 3,000 due to planned maintenance. The utility has managed to stave off rolling blackouts in recent weeks. #PowerAlert2Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 16:00 until 21:00 tonight due to shortage of generation capacity@News24 @SABCNews @NewzroomAfrika @eNCA @IOL @ewnupdates @SundayTimesZA @SowetanLIVE @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/YijqEXvEJm  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
