It said the violence and destruction came in the middle of harvesting season and had caused irrecoverable losses to cane growers and workers. Damage to the sector has been put at 353,000 tons of sugarcane that's been lost to arson attacks. At R600 per ton, this equated to a revenue loss of more than R211 million. The association said millers have been equally devastated as all sugar mills in KwaZulu-Natal had been forced to cease operations. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
