Mohamed said that government's management of the crisis was shocking. “This is the time for President Ramaphosa to step up and to really show that he's in charge because we can't just say sorry. In this instance, sorry is not acceptable, the question is what are you going to do about it?” Mohamed said. The NGO said that all those linked to the violence must be held accountable through fair trials. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
