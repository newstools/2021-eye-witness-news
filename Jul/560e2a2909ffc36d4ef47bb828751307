JOHANNESBURG - The owners of the Ticketpro Dome said they'd lost greatly due to the prolonged pandemic and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and had therefore had to sell the venue. The Dome is South Africa’s largest indoor arena and has hosted prominent local and international artists over the past two decades. The Sasol Pension Fund, which owned the arena, said that it took this decision due to force majeure. South Africans on social media went down memory lane remembering events that they attended at The Dome since it opened its doors in 1998. People have been remembering concerts by the likes of Pink, Katy Perry, Lira, Black Coffee and Lauryn Hill among many others. And who can forget the story of artist Cassper Nyovest, who became the first South African artist to sell out The Dome. Nyovest said that he had plans in place to repeat history at the arena. “Funny enough, we were actually planning to go back to The Dome and hearing this is a bit sad,” he said. Carol Weaving from RX Venue Management, which has been managing The Dome, said that it had been a difficult time. “We haven’t had an event in 2020 or 2021 and I think that’s the difficulty for many exhibition events companies and venues, ” she said. It's not yet clear who will be assuming the ownership of the venue, but it is said that they’re not in the events space. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
