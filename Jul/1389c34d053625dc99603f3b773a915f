CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town suburb plagued by crime and other social ills will soon count an Olympian as a resident. Bonteheuwel table tennis champion, Theo Cogill, is gearing up to represent South Africa at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games between 24 August and 5 September. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie said that the 34-year-old would be the first-ever Bonteheuwel resident to compete at an Olympic Games. Cogill's love for table tennis started at the age of 12 when he and his cousin picked up a door and a few other pieces of wood to build a makeshift table tennis table. He later joined a club and a coach spotted his talent.   Next, he made the Western Province team and earned his national colours while competing in a number of tournaments across the globe. However, in 2011, Cogill was stabbed in the neck while trying to break up a fight and suffered a major spinal injury. He had to learn to walk again and with hard work and determination, he was back at the table, paddle in hand.   Now the 34-year-old is preparing for the Paralympics: “I’m still shocked though; I’ve been to a lot of tournaments and the Olympics are a big deal and qualifying for the Olympics alone is a big deal.” The role model also shares his love for the sport by coaching table tennis in the Bonteheuwel community.
