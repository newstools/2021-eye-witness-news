JOHANNESBURG – The Automobile Association (AA) has called on South Africans to limit all non-essential travel, warning of a possible fuel price hike in the coming days. The association has predicted a significant rise in the price of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin month-end. It said the daily Rand to US dollar exchange rate has spiked as well as international oil prices. “The AA’s forecast, based on mid-month data, indicates that petrol is set for an increase of 87 cents per litre; diesel 58 cents per litre; and illuminating paraffin 56 cents. The weakening rand, as a result of the riots, will, however, play a major role as the exchange rate is a major indicator for the local fuel price.” Earlier in the week, there were concerns of fuel shortages following an interruption to supply that was caused by the week-long violence. This resulted in government restricting the bulk sale of fuel, as many began to panic buy. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy enforced a law prohibiting South Africans from purchasing petroleum products in portable containers.
