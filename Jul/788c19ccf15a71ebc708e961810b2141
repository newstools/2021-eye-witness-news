While her classmate Kenneth Simmons said that online learning afforded him the opportunity to focus on his soccer career. “I wanted to give more time to my soccer and have more free time as well at home,” he said. Head of the St Stithians Online School, Tessa Venter, said that the COVID-19 pandemic gave them an opportunity to successfully launch the school earlier this year. “We currently have students all over South Africa and from all over the world actually," she said.
