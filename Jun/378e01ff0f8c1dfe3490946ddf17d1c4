CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Government aims to speed up the province's vaccination drive with the rollout of more vaccine sites. As part of the plan, health authorities intend to increase the number of daily vaccinations administered at three mega-sites in the mother city. Deep in the throes of a COVID-19 third wave, officials are dealing with a rapidly increasing active caseload. About 1,200 new cases are being recorded in the province daily and around 90 patients are being admitted to hospitals every day. In an effort to ramp up the Cape's vaccination drive, three mega vaccine sites will help ensure authorities are able to expand their reach. At the Parc Du Cap vaccination site, Capetonians can already roll up their sleeves to receive a jab, but two other sites are yet to open their doors.
