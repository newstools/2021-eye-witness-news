Gigaba is on Friday denying accounts of various witnesses who said he lived a lavish-cash-lifestyle courtesy of the Gupta family.

Hut he admits he has an eye for style - especially Fabiani. “They’ve got beautiful pocket squares, great perfume and jeans. I’m not trying to advertise them but they’re quite a good brand.” WATCH: Malusi Gigaba continues testimony at state capture inquiry  Gigaba also said he was never aware that the Guptas offered the former SAA CEO Vuyisile Kona a R100,000 - and upped it to R500,000 when he refused to do their bidding. He said he cooled down his relationship with the Guptas because of their behavior. Evidence leader Advocate Anton Myburgh asked Gigaba if he knew that his advisor Siyabonga Mahlangu arranged a meeting between the Guptas and Kona or that Kona was offered money in that meeting. Gigaba said he was not aware, yet he decided to distance himself. “Because of my friendship with Ajay and I began to view this conduct, the name dropping and a number of things, as quite disappointing. That led to me cutting off my relationship with them.” Gigaba denies that Mahlangu was acting on his instructions. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
