Teacher unions are breathing a sigh of relief as the vaccination programme for educators seems set to begin across the country. On top of the 300,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines, more jabs are said to arrive in the country to ensure educators are inoculated before primary school pupils returned to daily timetables. Sadtu’s Mugwena Maluleke has welcomed the Johnson & Johnson doses. "The 300,000 doses that are going to be availed for the teachers must be welcomed as one of the first line of defense,” said Maluleke. While Naptosa’s Basil Manuel said he hoped more vaccines will be arriving in the country as soon as possible. “So, we've already asked what is the possibility of leveraging additional doses because the 300,000 won't cover all the education workers,” he said. All school staff will qualify for the jobs and not just those age 40 and above. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
