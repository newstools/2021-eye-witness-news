JOHANNESBURG –President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would like to see black businesses capitalising on vaccine manufacturing. The President said this as he prepares to take his bid for vaccine waivers to the G7 next week. South Africa and India have proposed the temporary waiver of patents to COVID-19 vaccines in a bid for more equitable access and distribution. Ramaphosa told guests at the Black Management Forum’s 45th-year anniversary dinner on Friday night that he will be advocating to the World Trade Organisation - mostly in Europe, which had been reluctant to agree to the intellectual property lift.
