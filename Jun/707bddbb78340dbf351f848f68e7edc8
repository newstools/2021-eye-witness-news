CAPE TOWN - Some poorer countries were running out of coronavirus vaccines. This was the warning from the World Health Organization (WHO). A large number of poorer countries receiving vaccines through a global sharing scheme did not have enough doses to continue programmes, the WHO added. The Covax programme has delivered 90 million doses to 131 countries.
