JOHANNESBURG - The Emfuleni local municipality in the Vaal claimed that the water supply to all affected areas had been restored. The area has been experiencing ongoing water problems due to a burst water pipe. The Vaal Dam supplies water to Vanderbijlpark, Bophelong, Tshepiso and Boipatong. Residents have taken to social media to express dissatisfaction and dismay with not having had water for the past week. Municipality spokesperson Makhosonke Sangweni said that they were working on fixing the issue. "It's true that we've been having water shortages from last week Thursday. From that day to today we've had a contractor on site to try and fix the problem. They tried to close it but it was leaking at some point and obviously, they couldn't fill up. But we've been working on it." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
