JOHANNESBURG – The department of basic education (DBE) said on Sunday the Limpopo province needed one more day to complete its vaccination rollout for the education sector. The province launched its vaccination drive for teachers and school support staff on Friday, where over 38,000 employees are expected to receive the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson jab.
