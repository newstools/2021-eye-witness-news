CAPE TOWN - The Netcare Hospital Group is now caring for 45% more COVID-19 patients in Gauteng than it did at the peak of the pandemic’s second wave. Hospital management has reiterated the Delta variant, which is 50-60% more transmissible than the Beta variant, is driving the surge in new coronavirus cases being recorded in the province. Data released by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) shows 8,925 new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Gauteng on Tuesday. Gauteng accounts for 67% of new COVID-19 cases recorded in the country on Tuesday.

Friedland urged South Africans eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination to line up for the jab. “Just from our experience with Netcare, we have vaccinated over 33,000 of our frontline workers and only 200 of them have been reinfected and that’s less than 0.6% and only seven required hospitalisation.” The hospital group said it was continuously making more capacity available to treat patients and had acquired an additional 1,000 oxygenators and 100 mechanical ventilators.
