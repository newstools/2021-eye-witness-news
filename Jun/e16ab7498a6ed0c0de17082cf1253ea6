JOHANNESBURG - Eskom CEO André De Ruyter said that those who knew him would agree that was is not racist and that the allegations against him were baseless. "This has been corroborated by the board, it has been supported by my executive committee, which is I think is certainly the most diverse team I've worked with during my 30-year career," De Ruyter said in an interview on 702's Midday Report on Thursday. He was responding to allegations levelled against him by former Eskom chief procurement officer, Solly Tshitangano who accused him of racism and of not complying with procurement and recruitment policies.

Tshitangano, who has since been fired for poor performance, reported the matter to President Cyril Ramaphosa, among others. De Ruyter said that he'd made a number of appointments to his exco to fill vacancies and not one of those was a white person. "To leap to the conclusion that holding someone accountable for performance now equates to a systematic purge of black executives is just not substantiated by the fact."
