READ: How to check your load shedding schedule In a statement released on Wednesday morning, the utility said that the rolling power cuts were due to delays in returning generation units to service at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Kendal and Koeberg power stations. Eskom has apologised for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the power cuts and asked South Africans to cut down consumption of electricity. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha: "It is, therefore, necessary to implement load shedding continuously during this period in order to replenish the emergency reserves. Eskom will communicate promptly should there be any changes. Breakdowns currently total 13,752MW of capacity while planned maintenance is 1,200MW." #POWERALERT1Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 10:00 this morning until 22:00 on Sunday night due to delays in returning generating units pic.twitter.com/aeS1oqVKl4  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
