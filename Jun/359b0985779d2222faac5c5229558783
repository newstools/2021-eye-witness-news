CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Department of Health on Tuesday said it would be able to vaccinate 120,000 residents every week. That's provided it gets sufficient supply and it's allowed to use the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. Vaccines have been administered to more than 200,000 residents. Western Cape head of health Dr Keith Cloete said they were only able to administer between 60,000 and 65,000 vaccines this week because of the quantity of Pfizer doses at hand.

Our private sector hospitals are starting to increase faster than our public sector hospitals, so we are very much closing in and entering an established third wave. We will be making an announcement later this week.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
