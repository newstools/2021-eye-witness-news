Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha: "This load shedding will also assist to replenish the emergency generation reserves which have been utilised extensively over the past three weeks to avoid load shedding during the day. During this 24-hour period, a generating unit each at Kriel and Arnot returned to service. This, however, is not sufficient to eliminate load shedding for the rest of the week."
