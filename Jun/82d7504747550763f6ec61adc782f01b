CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has expressed concern by the brazen criminality some arrestees had shown in recent weeks. In the latest incident, a drunk driver who was pulled over in Blue Downs on Sunday took one last swig of his brandy before Metro police officers apprehended him. The 29-year-old suspect was detained at the Mfuleni Police Station. The city's JP Smith: "We continue to see too many people with a total disregard for the law which jeopardises public safety. Only harsh consequences from the courts will turn this tide." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
