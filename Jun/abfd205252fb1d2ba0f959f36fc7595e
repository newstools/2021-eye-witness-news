JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is spending part of Youth Day at the Uitsig High School in Centurion. The school that found itself in the centre of a furore after a video emerged showing  security guards manhandling a learner who was wearing an EFF beret. EFF members arrived at the school as early as eight o ‘clock on Wednesday morning to prepare for the organisation’s 16 June commemoration. The group was toyi toying just outside the school gate. They said the party is taking the rally to the school to demand an end to racism. And they're eagerly awaiting the arrival of party leader Julias Malema who's scheduled to address them. Police are monitoring the situation with only a few residents walking around. And others watching from their windows.
