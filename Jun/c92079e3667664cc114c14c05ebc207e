JOHANNESBURG – Dube residents who this week protested over electricity-related issues are hoping these will be resolved so they don’t repeat the demonstration and disrupt services in the Soweto neighbourhood. Those who took part in the two-day demonstration claim they have not had power for eight months. They decided to suspend their protest after they got feedback from ward councillor Ben Seahutse about his meeting with Eskom officials.

Meanwhile, Saturday also saw residents from areas including Westdene, Coronation, and Brixton marching to City Power’s offices over issues relating to electricity.
