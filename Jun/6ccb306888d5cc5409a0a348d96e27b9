CAPE TOWN - A man has been sentenced to six years in prison, four of which were suspended, for contravening customs regulations. Sheik Aboo Muhammed Zakkariyah was sentenced earlier this week. He was arrested in May 2018 at Cape Town International Airport after customs officials found nearly R2 million in cash hidden inside his luggage. He was to fly to Dubai. Zakkariyah was charged for contravening the Customs and Excise Act. He eventually entered into a plea agreement and was subsequently found guilty. The man will effectively serve two years imprisonment. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
