According to the latest report by Scorpio, documents revealed how the controversial company allegedly transferred R160,000 to a Pietermaritzburg car dealership for a 2003 Toyota Land Cruiser. It is understood that the car was subsequently registered in Dedani Mkhize's name. According to photographs posted on social media, the vehicle appears to have been put to use at a farm near Pietermaritzburg owned by the minister's son.
