Municipal IQ economist, Karen Heese, said that these demonstrations could have been sparked by a number of reasons. "There has been quite profound dysfunction at municipal level and there does seem to be some degree of political involvement." Heese warned that the Free State could see an increase in protests due to collapsing key services. "Given what's happened in the last month or so and the difficulties that the Free State has seen in service delivery." Since January, the county has witnessed 53 major service delivery protests, with Gauteng leading the pack. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
