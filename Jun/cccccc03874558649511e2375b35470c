LAUSANNE - UEFA said on Thursday it was scrapping the away goals rule for all of its club competitions from next season. Introduced in 1965, the rule was used to determine the winner of a two-legged knockout tie in cases where the two teams had scored the same number of goals on aggregate over the two matches. From the 2021-2022 season, if the two teams score the same number of goals over the two legs, the tie will be decided by playing two 15-minute periods of extra time at the end of the second leg. In the event that the teams score the same number of goals or fail to score at all during extra time, there will then be a penalty shootout.
