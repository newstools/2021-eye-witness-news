JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has moved South Africa to lockdown level 3 with the curfew now starting at 10 pm until 4 am. He is addressing the nation on Tuesday night following a meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council, the President’s Coordinating Council and Cabinet. “I fully understand that you are concerned about constraints that restrict your freedom to travel, to gather, to socialise, to worship and, in some instances, even to earn a living." He said government continuously aimed to prevent the spread of the virus while safeguarding the economy. "In view of the rising infections, we have therefore decided to move the country to alert level 3. This will take effect later this evening once the regulations have been gazzetted. It remains mandatory for every person to wear a face mask that always covers their nose and mouth at all times when in public spaces. It is a criminal offence not to do so." Gauteng, Free State, Northern Cape and the Western Cape are in the third wave, the president said. “The proportion of COVID tests that are positive – the so-called positivity rate – is continuing to rise in Gauteng, Limpopo, Western Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal. Of these, Gauteng has been the worst hit.” The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has also been adjusted and is now permitted between 10 am and 6 pm from Monday to Thursday. "Alcohol sales for on-site consumption will be permitted as per licence conditions up to 9 pm. Alcohol consumption in all public spaces, such as beaches and parks, is strictly prohibited. Non-essential establishments like restaurants, bars and fitness centres will need to close by 9 pm to allow their employees and patrons to travel home before the start of the curfew," the president added.
