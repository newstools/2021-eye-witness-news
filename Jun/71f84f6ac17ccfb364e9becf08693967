JOHANNESBURG – The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has said it will hold assets belonging to the Guptas and their lieutenant Iqbal Sharma – including a R21 million house in Constantia near Cape Town – until the fraud and money laundering case against them and three former Free State agriculture officials is concluded. If they are convicted, the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) will apply for a confiscation order against Sharma and the company Islandsite, to recoup the value of benefits derived from the offences and related criminal activities.
