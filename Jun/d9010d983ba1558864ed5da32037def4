CAPE TOWN – President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the country's COVID-19 vaccination programme would not be ‘derailed’ by corruption allegations marring Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. Ramaphosa told a post-budget media briefing on Thursday that the Digital Vibes debacle was receiving his full attention. In a rare press conference, President Ramaphosa faced a barrage of questions about his health minister.

He said that the matter, already being probed by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), would not affect the inoculation plan which has also been criticised as being too slow. “Is this going to lead to vaccination programme lagging or being derailed? I don’t think so. The vaccination process is under the direction of the IMC which the deputy president is leading.” Ramaphosa said that he got reports on the arrival of vaccine doses from the inter-ministerial committee, led by David Mabuza, on a regular basis, and he added that the country's vaccination drive was proceeding well.
