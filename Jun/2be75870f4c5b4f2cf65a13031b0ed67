CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) has rallied behind embattled Health Minister Zweli Mkhize defending his decision not to appear before Parliament. Mkhize was a no-show on Friday morning, citing legal opinion, which recommended that he not attend the meeting to discuss the irregular Digital Vibes contract. The minister and director general Dr Sandile Buthelezi refused to brief the committee on the matter because of criminal complaints and the SIU investigation. ANC members of the health committee came to Mkhize’s defence for his non-appearance due to legal concerns. ALSO READ: MAHLATSE MAHLASE: Ramaphosa has enough to act on with Mkhize. So why won't he?
