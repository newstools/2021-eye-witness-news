JOHANNESBURG - The National Liquor Traders Council (NLTC) has urged government not to impose tough COVID-19 restrictions on the sale of alcohol. Much of South Africa is gripped by the third wave of infections. Several bans on liquor sales imposed since South Africa was placed under a state of disaster more than a year ago helped free up bed space in trauma units but hit the alcohol industry hard. The council's Lucky Ntimane said: "Liquor traders and certainly taverners are united in the fight against COVID-19 and we are doing everything possible to keep our customers and staff safe. No one will come to a tavern expecting to misbehave or disregard the safety protocols. We won't accept it." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
