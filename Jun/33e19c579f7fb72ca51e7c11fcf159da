Connor said that the frightening experience was something that he never wants to relive and that he panicked. "It wasn't great at all. I was scared because I sleep by my grandparents every weekend. When we got infected with COVID, I was scared because I slept there, so just please stay safe everyone." The boys' mother, Kelly, who's a high school teacher, said that she was grateful that her children's symptoms weren't as severe as what she and her husband experienced. "The effects of COVID-19 on the little ones, they bounce back really quickly but it was still obviously scary," she said. Carter is urging the public to adhere to health safety rules, to prevent further hospitalisations and loss of life. "COVID is a real killer. Please guys, can you please keep away from others? Please stay safe, wear your mask, sanitise." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
