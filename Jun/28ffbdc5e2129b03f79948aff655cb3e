CAPE TOWN - Civil society organisations have on Wednesday made in support of a parliamentary inquiry into the Public Protector. Lawyers for the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) and Corruption Watch have opposed Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s application to have Parliament’s impeachment rules declared unconstitutional. The organisations have joined proceedings as “friends of the court”. The Casac and Corruption Watch said South Africa was on par with international standards when it came to removing a chapter nine head or a person in a similar position.
