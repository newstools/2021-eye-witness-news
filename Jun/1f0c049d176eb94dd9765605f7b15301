JOHANNESBURG - Power cuts are no respecter of positions. This was evident during a live interview of Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu with SABC show host Vuyo Mvoko on Wednesday when her power cut and she exclaimed "oh no!". South Africa is currently experiencing stage three rolling power cuts as Eskom battles a number of infrastructure issues.

The good thing about loadshading is that it affects everyone.  There is no VIP section in loadshedding  I only saw it this morning after a very long loadshedding and i just smile and We must thank ANC voters.  The news anchor is professional shame I was gonna laugh yoh  I dont trust these people, this mightve been planned to entrench the idea that loadsheding affects everyone  #Loadshedding is showing us . It sounded like she was at the climax of her speech and #Eskom be like not today sweets, not today  So an entire minister whos working closely with the masters of loadshedding didnt have loadshedding schedule around her area vele.  why the bloody hell did they stop the interview this was an opportunity for this journalist  South Africans have also vented to Eyewitness News about their frustrations, amid the prospect of colder dark nights to come.

"We can't cook or the geyser is off which means you can't bath," one man said. "I don't get to organise and plan my day well. It's really sad," a woman said.
