GAUTENG COVID-19 INFECTIONS A GROWING CONCERN At the same time, acting Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said she would be meeting with the National Coronavirus Command Council next week Tuesday where a report would be tabled on the growing concerns of daily COVID-19 infections in Gauteng. The acting minister met with the Gauteng government on Thursday and will be meeting with the ministerial advisory committee on COVID-19 on Saturday to discuss concerns during the third wave, especially in Gauteng. Politicians and scientists are begging the citizens of Gauteng to do the basics to curb the spread of COVID-19. Professor Bruce Mellado of the premier's advisory committee said that if the infections continue at this pace, drastic action would be called for. Chair of the committee, Dr Mary Kawonga, said that that they did not believe that a move to level 5 would be a good idea, rather, they were looking at a hybrid model incorporating some level 3 restrictions with some level 4 restrictions.
