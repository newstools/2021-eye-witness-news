He was found guilty on 10 counts of fraud and one count of money laundering. A total sum of R4.1 million was reportedly transferred from the municipality's account to accounts belonging to Scholtz and that of a friend where Scholtz created fraudulent beneficiary names in order to hide the fact that money was being paid directly to his personal bank account. He reportedly made 10 transactions over a period of three months during which he stole money for personal use and out of these 10 transactions, two were transferred to his friend who later returned the bulk of the money received back to Scholtz. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment of which four years were suspended on condition that he is not found guilty of theft or fraud in the period of suspension.
