JOHANNESBURG – The news of the relaxation of schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act to allow providers to generate more power without having to go through a long-drawn-out licencing process might be welcome, but it's not likely to save us from a gruelling and dark winter. Energy experts have warned of an increase in blackouts in the coming weeks.

With the added load of equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19, it’s got even worse. Energy expert Lungile Mashele said hospitals, industries, and homes were now competing for electricity for life-saving machines, manufacturing, and space heating.

You cannot have a system, and this is absolute failure, where you move from stage 2 load shedding to stage 4 – in one afternoon – then the next morning then we are told ‘ok, we are going to stage 2’ and then an hour later we are told it's stage 3.” Mashele said the intensified blackouts were bad news for the country’s ailing infrastructure, as some residents could be without electricity for an average of six hours a day.
