He's been fighting his sentence with appeals and applications for early parole. The family said they had been called to participate in a mediation process with Moodley but they were not interested. Rob Matthews said they wanted Moodley to stay behind bars. "There's never going to be a reconciliation between Moodley and ourselves. He's messed our lives up, he's messed a lot of people's lives up and he's lied so many times that it's hardly of any benefit to get in front of Mr Moodley for the truth. But once we that information out of Correctional Services, there may be other areas that we're not aware of, so we've not made a decision yet." Matthews’ family said they were angry and confused over a looming parole hearing for their Moodley. Rob said they didn’t understand why they were informed that Moodley’s eligibility for parole. “When he was given the life sentence, my family and I thought that was great. When someone gets a life sentence, that sentence has to be carried out.” Meanwhile, their lawyer said they would be opposing any such parole application.
