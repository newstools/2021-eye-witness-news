CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he had talked to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize about the Digital Vibes scandal. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was investigating allegations involving two of Mkhize’s close associates and a R150 million, irregular contract between the company and the Department of Health. Ramaphosa said that Mkhize was “cooperating fully”. With a step-aside standoff within his own party, the start of a massive vaccine rollout and a looming third wave of the pandemic, the scandal embroiling his Health minister could not have come at a worse time for Cyril Ramaphosa.
