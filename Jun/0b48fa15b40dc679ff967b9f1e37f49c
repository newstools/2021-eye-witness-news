We understood that our personal interests as leaders could not be greater than the rights of our people.” Also addressing those who attended the funeral was North West Premier Job Mokgoro: “Those that served under his leadership at various roles describe him as an affable character, an approachable man, and a man who never saw himself above his kin; a man loyal to his organisation, but a man committed to his faith.” Tselapedi's son Tshepo read his father's obituary, which detailed his illustrious career in politics and in the clergy. “It is hard, as you can imagine, to summarise the life of a legend… A lion of the North West, in serving the people, has ceased to breathe.” Amongst those attending the official provincial funeral was former Premier Supra Mahumapelo; Tselapedi was touted to succeed Mahumapelo following his 2018 ousting Earlier in the week, the African National Congress (ANC) described Tselapedi as “a humble, yet fierce opponent of the apartheid regime”, adding that death had robbed the liberation movement of a dedicated and committed servant of the people.
