CAPE TOWN - One South Africa Movement chief activist Mmusi Maimane has differed with medical experts and has called for the local government elections to go ahead as planned. The former DA leader has made an oral submission at the inquiry into ensuring free and fair local government elections during COVID-19. He joins organisations and medical experts who have made submissions at the inquiry arguing for and against the postponing of the local polls in October. Maimane’s submission at the IEC inquiry on free and fair elections follows those of medical experts who have called for the postponement of the local polls. They said the lack of vaccinations and herd immunity by October could pose a health risk.

This is why we say that postponing these elections can only be a last resort.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
