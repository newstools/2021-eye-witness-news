JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has given Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga  seven days to shut down schools over fears of rising COVID-19 cases amongst learners or it will take matters into its own hands. During a media briefing at the party’s offices on Thursday afternoon, its leader Julius Malema questioned the whereabouts of Motshekga, claiming she had been absent from key events including the release of matric results. Motshekga – who was present during the announcement in February - had contracted COVID-19 at the beginning of the year. The EFF leader also alluded to the minister being down with cancer, but she is on the job and is expected to visit and inspect schools in Limpopo on Friday.

We give the minister seven days to close schools, failure to do so, we’ll have to close schools ourselves as the EFF.” Using his own experience with his children, the EFF’s commander in chief said all three had been turned back from schooling due to their own classmates contracting the virus. Malema also called on private schools to lead in the calling off learning – saying children had become recent victims of the pandemic and that the EFF would not allow them to die on its watch. #EFFPresser addressed by CIC @Julius_S_Malema https://t.co/xL99EXrwDE  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
