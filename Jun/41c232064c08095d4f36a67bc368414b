JOHANNESBURG - The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) has on Monday warned of a potential strike if its members reject the latest offer of a 4% salary hike. Wage negotiations between unions and the South African Local Government Association started in March. Workers are demanding a R4,000 salary increase across the board. Samwu said with the proposed increase, the least paid workers would receive a salary hike of R356 before tax. The union's Papikie Mohale said: “Should the workers reject it and the majority of them vote that we go on strike, we will go on strike.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
