CAPE TOWN - Sixty-four percent of COVID-19 fatalities in the Northern Cape were people aged 60 years and older. Provincial health bosses said that 1,100 people who contracted the coronavirus had passed on. Officials were on a drive to boost registrations on the Electronic Vaccine Data System and so far, 27,038 people had registered. The Northern Cape was one of four provinces that had already entered a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cluster outbreaks at schools, social gatherings and non-adherence to safety measures were key areas of concern. Acting Head of Health, Riaan Strydom, said that the phase 2 vaccination drive would be expanded to include all five regions in the province from next week. "Seventy-nine percent of those that have passed away, unfortunately, had co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular diseases. I think that's why it is important we complete our 60-year-olds in terms of the vaccination drive." The province has a target to vaccinate 118,000 people over 60 years. Premier Zamani Saul stressed the benefits of getting a COVID-19 jab. "By getting vaccinated you are protecting yourself and those around you. People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 must still take precautions such as wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, washing or sanitising their hands." Eleven schools in the province were still closed as part of measures to rein in infection numbers. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
