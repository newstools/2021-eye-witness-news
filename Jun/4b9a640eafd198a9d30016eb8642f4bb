JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said embattled Health Minister Zweli Mkhize had been treated with kid gloves by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Malema - during a media briefing on Thursday afternoon - said the EFF took exception to Mkhize being placed on special leave following the Digital Vibes tender saga. His family is said to have benefitted from the irregular multi-million contract awarded to his close associates.

Malema said Mkhize - like several other leaders linked to Ramaphosa who had been found wanting in personal protection equipment corruption claims in Gauteng - was also still on the job. “All of this proves that the Ramaphosa Administration is tolerant to corruption and selective in dealing with the corrupt, it also tolerates incompetency, particularly from members of its cabal.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
