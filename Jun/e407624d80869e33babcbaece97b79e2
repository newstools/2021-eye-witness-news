JOHANNESBURG - Auditor-General Tsakani Maluleke said the number of clean audits at the country’s 257 municipalities had gone down from 33 to 27. Maluleke has tabled a consolidated general report on the local government audit outcomes for the 2019-20 financial year to Parliament. She said widespread non-compliance with legislation and reported material non-compliance was at 86% of municipalities. Maluleke said non-compliance with supply chain management legislation was still prevalent, and it significantly contributed to the irregular expenditure of R26 billion in the 2019-2020 financial year. She added that 64%of municipalities did not provide adequate records even though the cost of financial reporting including consultants amounted to over R5 billion - this was the cost of salaries of finance units and financial reporting consultants. Only 2% of municipalities used consultants to bridge the vacancy gap, while others paid consultants even though their finance units are well capacitated.
