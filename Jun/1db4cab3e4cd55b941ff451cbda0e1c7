JOHANNESBURG - As the nation waits to see whether the former president will hand himself in, the Correctional Services Department said he would be processed according to their rules. It goes without saying that former President Jacob Zuma  is no ordinary inmate. So, who decides where he will be serving his 15-month jail sentence and what is the process of being admitted as a prisoner? According to Correctional Services, a warrant of detention issued by a court specifies where a sentenced prisoner will be incarcerated.

But what really guides us is the outcome of the assessment that we conduct because it looks at a range of factors." Correctional Services said it could not say at this stage which facility would be best suited to house the former president as he was yet to be formally admitted as a prisoner.
