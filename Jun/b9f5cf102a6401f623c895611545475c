CEO Dirk Herman said: "Solidarity can also confirm that the Cubans do not meet the SA requirements for registration and licensing. We can also reveal that the taxpayer will probably pay R75 million for this project and not R65 million." Aside from laying a complaint with the Public Protector, the union will also return to court later this month. Meanwhile, the Water and Sanitation Minister Department has accused the union of being bitter and xenophobic. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
