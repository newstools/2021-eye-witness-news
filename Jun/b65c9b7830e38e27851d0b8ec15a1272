READ: 300,000 J&J vaccine doses cleared to be shipped to SA as a matter of urgency Kubayi-Ngubane said the contamination of the vaccines is a major setback to the country's immunisation campaign. "Two million doses that are affected but currently in the store warehouse in Gqeberha, so obviously we can't ignore the fact that it takes our vaccine to roll out a bit backwards". She however said the country will get another batch of 300 000 jabs next.
