At the same the IEC is gearing up for the last of its by-elections ahead of the local government poll. On Wednesday this week, the IEC will rollout voting stations at eight contested wards in various provinces. Candidates are vying for seats in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape and the Western Cape. While there's no shadow poll for the current epicenter of infections - Gauteng - the IEC’s Masego Shiburi said they had refined and perfected their voting protocols. “We have no reason to believe that the by-elections have resulted in increased numbers of COVID." Polls open at 8 am on Wednesday with 14 candidates contesting from 14 different political parties. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS or Android device.
