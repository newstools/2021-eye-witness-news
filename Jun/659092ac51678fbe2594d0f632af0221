Ramaphosa said the Mkhize matter was on his desk and he was dealing with it: “If nothing would be addressed and dealt with, you would be justified in saying this is a risk. So, I am addressing it, I have met the minister, he has given me an explanation, investigations are under way and as more information comes to the fore, it is being addressed. I did say this matter would be addressed to finality – it will be a transparent process, and everybody will get to know what we have done.” On whether he is planning to reshuffle his Cabinet Ramaphosa had this to say: “Changes to Cabinet – yes I know you would want to know when is Cabinet being reshuffled, am I satisfied with the performance of ministers, should I change this one or that one – all I can say is that changes to the Cabinet are the prerogative of the president.” WATCH: Digital Vibes, firearms and load shedding - Ramaphosa answers media questions  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
