He was the most senior Richards Bay Minerals employee to die in violence that's been linked to the scramble for opportunities and resources at the Rio Tinto-owned mine. Rio Tinto is the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation. Its subsidiary, Richards Bay Minerals is the largest taxpayer in KwaZulu-Natal and the killing of Nico Swart has rattled senior government leaders, including Mantashe. “We had to come and visit here and reassure the company that working together, we can resolve this,” the minister said. At the same time, provincial authorities said that investigations into Swart’s murder were at an advanced stage and that police would work closely with RBM to get to the root cause of these crimes in Richards Bay.
