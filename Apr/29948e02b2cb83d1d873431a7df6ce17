CAPE TOWN - Dozens of people have on Friday marched to Parliament to express their anger over an apparent homophobic killing. Andile 'Lulu' Ntuthela was murdered in the Eastern Cape and his body was found last month. Some of the many young people and students travelled from other parts of the country to participate in the march to Parliament.   The demonstration was conducted under the banner #JusticeForLulu. While singing and chanting through the streets of Cape Town, protesters held placards, reading “queer lives matter" and "I’m sorry that we couldn’t protect you” among others. #JusticeForLulu Students and members of the LGBTQIA+ are getting ready to match up parliament.
