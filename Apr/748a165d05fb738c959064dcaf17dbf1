JOHANNESBURG – Transformation ombudsman of Cricket South Africa (CSA) Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza said that although the time allocated to him to transform the sport was short, he believed that it was still achievable. Ntsebeza will be taking up the role of transformation ombudsman for CSA from next month, by managing the independent complaints system. The advocate will be focusing on transformation, healing, uniting cricket players and fans while also dealing with allegations of racism experienced by some players. Ntsebeza said that they were now collecting written submissions to help with the transformation of CSA. “It will be a very broad brush against the canvas. This is something that needed more time. The interim board apparently felt that it could be done, but I realise that, though it is difficult, it is doable.” Cricket for Social Justice and Nation Building National RolloutThe Office of the Transformation Ombudsman can now receive complaints and/or submissions from former and current players, coaches, administrators, and stakeholders.
