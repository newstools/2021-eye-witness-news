CAPE TOWN - The Competition Commission said that subsidies for the taxi industry remained a concern for the sector. Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele released the final recommendations of the 2020 Public Transport Market Inquiry report on Wednesday. The inquiry focused on minibus taxis, busses, trains and e-hailing services.
