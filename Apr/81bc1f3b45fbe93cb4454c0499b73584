CAPE TOWN - There are questions over how rape cases are investigated and prosecuted after worrying statistics came out of Mitchells Plain on Monday. The Western Cape Department of Community Safety said the latest crime statistics showed that there were 131 rape cases reported to the Mitchells Plain and Lentegeur police stations between March to December 2020. However, that had not led to a single conviction. Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz said of the 131 reported rape cases at the two Mitchells Plain police stations, there were only 83 arrests. Fritz has questioned what has happened to the remaining 48 rape cases. He's also concerned that of the 83 cases, 59 people are still awaiting trial and only one trial has actually commenced. Fritz said he would write to the Western Cape Police Ombudsman to conduct a systemic investigation into how rape cases were reported and dealt with.
