JOHANNESBURG - Former State Security Minister David Mahlobo on Friday said he could not disclose whether former President Jacob Zuma  was the “client” referred to in an intelligence operation to arrest and unlawfully detain Zuma’s wife, MaNtuli. She had been accused of poisoning Zuma in 2014. Added to this, the operation known as Project Tin Roof has also shocked Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo who heard that intelligence agents held her against her will. Mahlobo was testifying at the state capture commission on Friday. Like all other intelligence projects, Mahlobo said he didn’t know the details, but for Project Tin Roof, he didn’t want to say what he did know.
