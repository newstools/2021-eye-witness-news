CAPE TOWN - Following countrywide by-elections, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has lost a seat in the Knysna Council to the African National Congress (ANC). The polls carry a bit more significance following the president's announcement that the local government elections will be held on 27 October. By-elections were held in 14 instead of 15 wards in the Western Cape on Wednesday after a Buffalo City vote had to be postponed due to a legal matter. Ballots were, however, cast in the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, the North West and the Northern Cape. In KwaZulu-Natal, the Inkatha Freedom Party lost a seat in the Maphumulo Municipality to the ANC. In the Western Cape, the national ruling party also gained a seat from the DA in the Knysna council after winning ward 11. The IEC said the average voter turnout for all the 14 wards in the Western Cape was 40.6%. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
