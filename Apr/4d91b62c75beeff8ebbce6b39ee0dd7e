JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - Traffic officials said there had been a significant increase of vehicles on the country's major routes as holiday makers took advantage of the Easter long weekend. Traffic officials staged massive operations in a bid to curb the carnage on the roads. Gauteng Traffic Police's Obed Sibasa said some freeways were extremely busy this afternoon. “With a count of 1,678 vehicles per hour on the N3 De Hoek Heidelberg toll gate heading to KZN. Equally, on the N1 to Limpopo and the N4 to Mpumalanga we have mounted multi-disciplinary operations across on local, provincial and national routes.” In the Western Cape, the Traffic Department's Jandre Bakker said they were monitoring most of the province's main routes. “The main routes in the province carry the most traffic.
