JOHANNESBURG — Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said South Africa would be negotiating for an additional 10 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinovac vaccines while the process of registering them for use in the country continued. Mkhize said the two vaccines were at different stages in the process of being registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA). The minister and department officials briefed Parliament’s health portfolio committee earlier on Wednesday.

He said the plan was to increase the daily vaccination rate to about 250,000 a day.
