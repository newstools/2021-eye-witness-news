JOHANNESBURG - The bail application for the man accused of being the mastermind behind the murder of Tshegofastso Pule was postponed to 22 April this year. Ntuthuko Shoba was applying for bail for the second time on Tuesday in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court based on new facts. He is accused of the premeditated murder of Pule who was found hanging from a tree in a veld in Roodepoort last June. Shoba was arrested earlier this year after his alleged accomplice, Muzikayise Malephane - the man who confessed to killing pule - turned state witness. The NPA's Phindi Mjonondwane said: “We’re at the bail application stage and it has been postponed to 22 April 2021 where the State will reply to his bail application.” Shoba has maintained his innocence and intends pleading not guilty when the matter goes to trial. He told the Roodepoort Magistrates Court he didn’t order the killing of his girlfriend, adding that he would prove this during trial. Shoba presented new evidence to the court on Tuesday, claiming he's been told by inmates at the Krugersdorp Correctional Services - where he's been kept - that his girlfriend was in fact in a relationship with Malephane, the man who confessed to killing the young woman. He told the court this was revealed to him by the inmate who also shared a cell with Malephane. In his affidavit, Shoba claims he was happy to find out that Pule was pregnant and he was paying for her doctor’s appointments and that he would never plan to kill the mother of his unborn child.
