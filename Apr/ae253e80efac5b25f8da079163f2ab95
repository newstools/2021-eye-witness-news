CAPE TOWN — In an effort to reduce queues and overcrowding at South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) offices, the national Department of Social Development has launched an online booking system for disability grants on Wednesday. Sassa, in collaboration with GovChat, developed an online booking system that will allow people to book for their medical assessments without visiting the local office. #SASSA #GovChat Social Development minister Lindiwe Zulu says it enables disability grant applicants to book their medical assessments without physically visiting SASSA offices.

We're thinking that we might even use volunteers.” Join SASSA, @The_DSD and @GovchatOrg as we launch the online booking system for Disability Grant assessment. #SASSACares pic.twitter.com/9ubep2ddwS  Mr Abraham Mahlangu, SASSA Western Cape Acting Regional Executive Manager, takes us through the process of booking a Disability Grant medical assessment online. #SASSACares @The_DSD @GovChat pic.twitter.com/Bg6XwBrzvA  The online booking will also address challenges associated with long queues at local offices and ensure that SASSA complies with COVID-19 regulations. @The_DSD Minister Lindiwe Zulu  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
