JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule has asked nine of the party’s provincial secretaries to submit a list of all party members facing charges of corruption, serious crimes and those reported to be involved in criminality. According to a leaked internal memo being circulated on social media, Magashule has widened the scope of names that should be submitted as per last month’s national executive committee resolution. The party resolved that those facing criminal charges should step aside within 30 days.

He also said that provinces must indicate if those affected had been notified in writing. The ANC’s Pule Mabe refused to be drawn into commenting on the memorandum. "What I can confirm is that he had a national working committee meeting. We will be able to issue a statement related to the outcomes of that NWC meeting." Eyewitness News understands that some of Magashule’s allies in the ANC are continuing to wage a fight against the resolution in a bid to prevent him from having to vacate his office.
