JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte, said party members would defend it against attempts by secretary-general Ace Magashule's supporters to destroy it.

There are hundreds of thousands of ANC members who will stand up and defend our organisation and decisions of the NEC. " Duarte said that she was ready to implement the ANC constitution, which could see her having to suspend Magashule should he refuse to step aside. “I am quite thick-skinned so they can go ahead and insult me as they want; it won’t stop me from implementing decisions of NEC."
