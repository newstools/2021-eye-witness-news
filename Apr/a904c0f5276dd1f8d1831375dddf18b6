CAPE TOWN — It's World Immunisation Week and the Western Cape Department of Health is calling on parents and guardians to ensure their children are inoculated against various diseases. The World Health Organisation said while immunisation saved millions of lives every year and was widely recognised as one of the world's most successful health interventions, many children had not been vaccinated due to the global pandemic. The department's Shimoney Regter said immunisation was free at clinics. “ When a child is unimmunised or has missed out on immunisations they run the risk of developing severe complications from vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles or pneumonia."
