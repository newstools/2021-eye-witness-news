JOHANNESBURG – The Gauteng Health Department said that there seemed to be greater public buy-in when it came to those willing to be vaccinated as the country continued to wait for more doses to arrive here on home soil. There are around 1. 25 million healthcare workers in South Africa and, so far, only about 283,000 had received the jab.   Government said that it would release more details in due course on the changes to its rollout plan, and which group could get ready to line up for their inoculations in the next few phases.

He said that they were on track in Gauteng and that they would make sure that they kept to their targets to vaccinate as many people as possible this year. "This is an unprecedented programme. We have never had this kind of programme or campaign of this magnitude ever in our country. But we are confident that we are on the right track and that we will be able to reach the targets that we have set for ourselves." The department said it’s doing all it can, relying on the supply of vaccines, in trying to vaccinate as many people as possible before a potential third wave of COVID-19 infections. Senabe said they were relying on the vaccine manufacturers and can only inoculate the next group of people when there they have stock. He said if there was to be another spike in infections, they want it to be as low as possible. “Even if it comes, we want to make it as flat as possible so that we don’t have the burden of people getting sick or dying of COVID. We are doing all that we can, and with the logistics that we have relying on the supplies from the manufacturers of these vaccines.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
