DURBAN - The family of a 34-year-old man from Ntuzuma in eThekwini who was brutally murdered in a suspected hate crime last week said that they wanted justice. Sphamandla Khoza’s body was discovered in a ditch near his home last Monday. He was last seen alive at a neighbour’s house where he was allegedly attacked following an alcohol-related brawl.

That was the last anyone saw him alive.” Ngidi described Khoza as being an affectionate young man who did not deserve to die the way he did. “He was going to turn 35 this year, and he was employed, just a bubbly loving person. He had a partner that he lived with, together with his grandmother. Spha adored his grandmother - they had a really good relationship." Khoza was laid to rest on Sunday. A suspect arrested in connection with his murder is expected to apply for bail in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
