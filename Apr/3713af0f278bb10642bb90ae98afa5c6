JOHANNESBURG - Members of Parliament and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said that they were dismayed by what they called the “onerous” terms put forward by vaccine manufacturers. Mkhize told Parliament's Health committee that Johnson & Johnson's terms before the company released 20 million doses were unfortunate.

He said that other manufacturers’ terms, like Pfizer’s, risked the country’s sovereignty. "This obligation to have a determination at the sole discretion of the manufacturer does not bind South Africa. As the government, we found ourselves in a precarious position of having to choose between our saving our citizen’s lives and risk putting the country’s assets into private companies hands." Like Mkhize, committee member Marie Sukers said that she was also taken aback by the terms. “Because I think a lot of us here are in dismay with the terms being demanded. I think it proves the point that politicians and business, it is a difficult combination,” she said. Mkhize has also welcomed an additional 10 million doses from Pfizer taking their total to 30 million doses. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
