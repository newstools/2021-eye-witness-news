JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he would not tolerate any kind of violent behaviour in the province’s schools. Lesufi strongly condemned a violent altercation that occurred between a group of matriculants at Parktown Boys High School this week. In a video that has been widely shared, a grade 12 pupil can be seen attacking another before being stopped by a group of pupils. “We do not tolerate any sort of violent behaviour in our schools. Learners must focus on their studies and if a matter arises which bothers them; they must consult with their educators or principals about it - instead of taking matters into their own hands,” said Lesufi. The matriculants involved in the altercation have since been suspended. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
