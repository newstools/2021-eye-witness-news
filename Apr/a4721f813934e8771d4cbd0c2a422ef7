CAPE TOWN — The process to select a Democratic Alliance (DA) mayoral candidate for Cape Town is not running smoothly. The party's federal legal commission has on Monday ruled the selection panel must be reconstituted. The three candidates are current Cape Town Mayor and DA metro chair Dan Plato, Western Cape leader and MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela and MP Geordin Hill-Lewis. The interview process was disrupted by a dispute around who may sit on the panel.

Current mayor Dan Plato, MP Geordin Hill-Lewis and suspended transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela have put their names forward for the position.
