JOHANNESBURG — The City of Johannesburg's first democratic Mayor Isaac Mogase has passed away. It's understood Mogase passed away on Wednesday morning. He held the position of first post-apartheid era mayor of the greater Johannesburg between 1995 and 2000. Described as an outstanding servant of the city, Mogase served as an activist before becoming a councillor and was part of the leadership of the Soweto crisis committee. City of Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo said Mogase played a pivotal role in laying the groundwork for local governance. “We are saddened as the City of Johannesburg on the passing of the first post-apartheid mayor of the greater Johannesburg metropolitan council, a struggle veteran who joined the African National Congress in Alexandra in the ’50s. He was very active in the National Congress Youth League."
