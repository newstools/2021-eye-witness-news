Mkhize told the health committee there were currently no direct flights between India and South Africa. He said three million Johnson and Johnson vaccines were due to arrive in the next two months. But pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding should not have the jab at this stage. “This is just a precautionary measure until we have got concrete information that comes from the scientists to say what do we need to look out for in this case. We hope that information will come in fairly soon”. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
