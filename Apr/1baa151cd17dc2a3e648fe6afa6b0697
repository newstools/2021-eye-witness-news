But the SRC said that it was unrealistic given that fewer than 20% of eligible students had registered so far. To make matters worse, some staff members were also on strike over salary demands. SRC president, Mthokozisi Gumede, said that students were also experiencing problems with accommodation, along with funding-related issues like the disbursement of laptops. For its part, the university said that some of the issues raised by students fell outside its control and institutions like NSFAS were better positioned to respond. Acting deputy vice-chancellor, Manyani Makua, said that they were exploring how they could better respond to issues raised by students ahead of the commencement of classes.
