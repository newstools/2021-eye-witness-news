JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma said he had a rethink about the country’s Constitution, which he claimed subverted the will of the people. This is revealed in leaked notes on Sunday, released under Zuma’s letterhead, of a meeting with African National Congress (ANC) top officials last month. Zuma met with the leaders of his party in the aftermath of the Constitutional Court’s ruling that he must be jailed for two years after he failed to present himself to the state capture commission as summonsed. The former president has made no secret of his disdain for the country’s judiciary; however, he took his discontent a step further in the meeting he had with the ANC leaders, including President Cyril Ramaphosa.
