The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape said that Madikizela claimed in his CV that he holds a BCom degree, however, this appeared to be a gross misrepresentation. The ANC's Cameron Dugmore said that he had written to the conduct committee chairperson in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, asking to convene the committee to investigate the allegation. "If it is true that an MEC has fraudulently submitted a CV, then this is a very serious matter and is a clear breach of the code of conduct governing all members of Parliament." He said that they had also asked Premier Winde to suspend the MEC while the investigation continued. Meanwhile, the Good Party has also called for Madikizela to quit or be fired.
