JOHANNESBURG - National Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank said that there was no evidence of billions of rands being deposited with the central bank in a so-called heritage fund. They also said that businessman Tokyo Sexwale  appeared to have been the target of a scam. During an interview on eNCA, Sexwale said that he was one of two people in charge of the fund aimed at helping students with free education, among other uses. He claimed that that the money was brought into the country and deposited with the central bank but had been stolen. The retired politician said that a large amount of money was brought into the country aimed at free education, new bullet trains and to help with the fight against COVID-19. The businessman said that President Cyril Ramaphosa and his predecessor Jacob Zuma knew about the funds which had now vanished, with the Reserve Bank being called on to provide answers. However, the Treasury's deputy Director-General Ismail Momoniat said that there was no trace of that deposit. "There are no bank records, if such evidence is provided, obviously one can assess that claim. Frankly, they're scams as we see it. We are skeptical given the size of the amount. The amount is so big, I don't have to tell you that a trillion rand is almost the size of our budget." Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said that he would reach out to Sexwale. Mr Tokyo Sexwales statement about stolen money is untrue, sad and seems that he was a victim of the many scams abound. You cannot steal transmitted money from the central bank. How? His statement on television was unfortunate. Will reach out to him.  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
