JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku on Monday said he would now take his Gauteng ANC disciplinary outcomes appeal to the African National Congress (ANC) at national level. The provincial disciplinary committee found Masuku guilty of bringing the ANC into disrepute over his department's personal protective equipment tender saga, which saw him being axed from his job. Masuku and presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko were hauled before a disciplinary committee after his department awarded her late husband Madzikane Diko a multimillion-rand tender. Speaking on Radio702 on Monday, the former MEC said he was appealing the outcome: “After I looked at the verdict, there are some things that are procedural that need to be sorted out by the national disciplinary committee.” LISTEN: In conversation with Bandile Masuku  Masuku said he would not turn his back on active politics despite his disappointment at being axed by Gauteng Premier David Makhura last year. He said he understood as an MEC, he served at the behest of the premier but that he believed he did his job diligently and was starting to turn the troubled department around. While Masuku did not win his case against the SIU in the courts, he said last week’s High Court outcome had cleared the doubt some had when it came to his credibility and integrity. “Upon examining all the evidence, the judge found that no corruption, nepotism, benefit was there. That is the most important aspect for me.” The former health MEC – in acknowledging that some used his woes to further their own political agendas – kept his cards close, refusing to divulge more on this issue. And while he has continued to volunteer in order to keep his skills sharp, he said now was not the time to return to private practice. “If you have to make a change in the political scene, you need to put all your energies into it.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
