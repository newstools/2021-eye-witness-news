JOHANNESBURG - Recently-appointed South African white-ball captain Temba Bavuma has been ruled out of the Twenty20 international series against Pakistan, which starts on Saturday, because of a hamstring injury. It is a further blow to South Africa, who are already missing five leading players because of Indian Premier League commitments. Wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen will take over as captain for the four-match series which gets under way at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Among the South African absentees not involved in the IPL are opening batsman Reeza Hendricks and all-rounder Dwayne Pretorius, while batsman Rassie van der Dussen is still recovering from a quad muscle injury. Hendricks has left the squad for the birth of his first child, while Pretorius has not fully recovered from a broken rib. Fast bowler Lungi Ngidi and leg-spinner Imran Tahir will be taking the field in the IPL for Chennai Super Kings as the first innings in Johannesburg draws to a close, while fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje are contracted to Delhi. David Miller will be playing for Rajasthan Royals. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
