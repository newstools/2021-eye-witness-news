JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema  claimed that the “sudden” announcement of the election date was meant to catch the EFF and other parties "off guard". The red berets were among those in discussions about the possible postponement of the October local government elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Malema said that President Cyril Ramaphosa mistook their objections as fear.

How can you do elections without door-to-door? How can we do elections without rallies? He said we must go to elections. There is no one that is going to tell us we are many here after we told them not to go to elections.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
