Snow had also been spotted over the Lesotho Highlands. Forecaster Kumsa Masizana, said on Friday: “For today, over those northeastern provinces, there are isolated and scattered thundershowers with a 30% to 60% chance (of rain) and then there’s an 80% chance of rain over the KZN province, as well as the extreme areas of the Eastern Cape.
