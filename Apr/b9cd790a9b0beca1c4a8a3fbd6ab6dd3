City of Johannesburg spokesperson Synock Matobako said the level above the dispensary, where the fire started, had caved in. “At the moment the fire is still burning, and the challenge is that we are doing external firefighting. We can’t go inside the building because the integrity of the structure of the building has been compromised.” The Gauteng health department has begun the process of evacuating to neighbouring hospitals. The cause of the fire was still unknown, and no casualties or injuries have so far been reported. More support vehicles on standby for evacuation. pic.twitter.com/S9gV2pnFpD  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
