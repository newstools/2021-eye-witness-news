JOHANNESBURG – Eskom has called on thousands of people in Katlehong and Vosloorus to switch off their electric appliances during this morning's so-called load reduction. The utility said doing so will protect these machines from possible power-surge damage when it restores electricity at 9 am. Eskom deliberately cut power to many communities in these parts of Gauteng at 5 am, with the utility saying it was safeguarding its network from overloading. Affected customers were asked not to report Friday morning’s four-hour blackout, but Eskom does want them to report illegal connections.
