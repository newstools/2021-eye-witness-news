CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has suspended Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela for 14 days pending the outcome of an investigation into his qualifications. This comes after Winde met with Madikizela on Wednesday to discuss the inaccuracies on his CV after he listed a BComm degree on his CV but acknowledged that he never actually completed the qualification. It's alleged that Madikizela lied about his qualifications.
