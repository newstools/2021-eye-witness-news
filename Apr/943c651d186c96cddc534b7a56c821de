JOHANNESBURG - Former Prasa Group Chief Executive Lucky Montana on Friday said it was not true that the rail agency had a R550 million irregular expenditure during his time in 2014. But he said the Auditor General issued qualified findings because of delayed audited financial statements. Montana is testifying about the rail agency at the state capture commission. He again blames former board chair Popo Molefe for distorting facts and misleading the commission.

In 2014, what caused the delay was the accounting treatment and the auditors had closed, in 2015, it is a different matter altogether.” Montana said Molefe inflated Prasa's irregular expenditure to create work for Werksmans Attorneys. He said Molefe even ignored former Minister Dipuo Peters when she queried the fees that were paid to Werksmans. Peters told the commission that she understood that Werksmans was appointed without procurement the first year but she didn’t understand why in the subsequent years, the contract was not regularised and she told Molefe to terminate it. Montana said: “To create work for Werksmans, they had to raise the numbers. The higher the irregular and wasteful expenditure at Prasa, the higher the value of 10% for Werksmans.” WATCH: Lucky Montana, former Prasa CEO, in hot seat at Zondo Inquiry  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
