JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of people woke up without electricity in Benoni, Brakpan, Nigel and Vosloorus this morning. Eskom deliberately cut supply to communities in these parts of Gauteng at 5am as part of its so-called "load reduction" timetable. The utility said it’s trying to protect its network from overloading. It said affected customers can expect their plug points to work again after 9 o'clock.
