CAPE TOWN - If South Africa had continued with its nuclear programme after commissioning Koeberg in 1984, the country would not have had to endure load shedding. That’s the view of Knox Msebenzi, managing director of the Nuclear Industry Association of South Africa. Msebenzi was taking part in a webinar hosted by the National Press Club earlier on Wednesday. READ: Eskom says no load shedding today after 4 units return to service The government’s controversial plans for a nuclear build programme that would have added 9,600mw to the grid were halted by a 2017 court case. Recently, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy issued a request for information (RFI) relating to building nuclear capacity of 2,500mw. Msebenzi said at least half, if not more, of the 24 gigawatts of coal-fired energy to be decommissioned by 2050 should be replaced by nuclear power.
