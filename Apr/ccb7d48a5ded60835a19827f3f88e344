Department spokesperson Kwara Kekana said, “We began evacuating patients early evening yesterday. At some point in the afternoon, we evacuated patients in the hospital from one ward to another, and then we took a decision to then evacuate patients out of the hospital to our sister hospitals around the province. That operation is still underway, we are still evacuating more patients out of the hospital.” Kekana said details about the number of patients that have so far been moved to neighbouring hospitals would be confirmed later on Saturday.
