JOHANNESBURG – Former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor Andile Lungisa has said he was still studying the High Court judgement ordering him to pay his former co-worker. On Saturday, it emerged that the court ruled in favour of Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Rayno Kayser. The court ordered Lungisa to pay Kayser R844,000 in damages for assault. This after he smashed a glass jug over Kayser's head during a heated council brawl. The DA councilor instituted a civil lawsuit against Lungisa following the assault, and the matter has been in and out of court for some time. Earlier Lungisa was sentenced to a jail term for the incident but was later released on parole.

If we fail on the appeal, I’ve got two cats at home which I own they can take one, and then I will remain with one.” This morning just received a donation of two cats from Zelda Ngxiki.
