JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Stock Exchange has on Friday confirmed that the alleged mastermind behind Tshegofatso Pule's murder Ntuthuko Shoba has been fired. Shoba was employed in the IT division of the JSE. He was arrested in February after his accomplice Muzikayise Malephane who confessed to killing Pule, turned State witness. He had been on cautionary suspension since his arrest. The young woman's body was found hanging from a tree last year; she was eight months pregnant. In a statement, the JSE said it had been assisting police with their investigations into the murder case and would continue to cooperate with officials when required to do so. The JSE said Shoba was no longer an employee at the organisation. During his second bail application, Shoba once again pleaded with the Roodepoort Magistrates Court to release him fearing that his continued incarceration would cost him his job. He has been in custody for about three months now. Pule's family said they had mixed emotions after Shoba was fired from his job on Friday. Her uncle Tumisang Katake said the family was still shocked following Thursday’s revelations in the court concerning WhatsApp messages between Shoba and Pule. He has commended the JSE for its decision. “Honestly speaking, we have mixed emotions, but we welcome the JSE’s decision.” Shoba is expected back in the dock on Monday.
