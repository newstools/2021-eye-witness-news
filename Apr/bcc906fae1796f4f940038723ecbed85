JOHANNESBURG - Religion and cultural oversight body, the CRL Rights Commission, has on Wednesday accused the owners of the Boulders Shopping Centre, Redefine Properties, of failing to endorse and uphold cultural inclusivity. The commission is holding hearings with the management of the Midrand shopping centre after a customer was ordered to leave because, according to the manager, his traditional attire was ‘indecent’. An altercation captured on video went viral, prompting an investigation by the commission.

Redefine Properties have since suspended Maponyane pending an internal investigation into the matter. The commission’s advocate Richard Botha said suspending Maponyane didn’t address why management and staff felt Mahlangu had to be ridiculed and intimidated. The commission’s Sylvia Pheto echoed the same sentiments, saying there was a clear lack of cultural inclusivity in the property giant’s policies. The commission has withheld its recommendations for Redefine Properties until Maponyane gives his testimony and response next week. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
