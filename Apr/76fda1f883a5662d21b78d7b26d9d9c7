JOHANNESBURG - Residents of KwaDabeka were left reeling from shock after the mutilated remains of a woman were found on the roadside near Pinetown. It's understood that the body of the 27-year-old woman was severed in half, wrapped in two black refuse bags and dumped on the side of a busy road. The gruesome discovery was made by residents on Thursday. The police's Thembeka Mbele said that the woman was reported missing last week by relatives, who said that she never returned home after a night out.
