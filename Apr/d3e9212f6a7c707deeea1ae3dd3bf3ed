CAPE TOWN – The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating the death of man in Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape. It's alleged that two police officers both fired two rounds with their service pistols when they were confronted by a suspect who allegedly pelted them with stones. He was also apparently armed with a knife and had been accused of killing his wife. Ipid's Ndileka Cola said: "It’s alleged he was hiding in a position surrounded by huge rocks with only one entry point. The officers could not run away, as running in a rocky forest area could endanger their own lives. It alleged that the police were left with no option but to defend themselves. The directorate continues to investigate this matter." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
