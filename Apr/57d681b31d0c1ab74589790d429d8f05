CAPE TOWN - From a cleaner to a teacher, and now on the verge of bachelor’s degree in education, Natasha Dietrich wants other adults to get an education. The 47-year-old spoke to Eyewitness News on Friday about her journey. Dietrich said she always knew there was more to life even while working as a cleaner at the University of the Western Cape. In 2014, she took the brave step to enrol as a full time student, while working a full time job. She said the students on campus motivated her. “If they can do it… then I can do it. On the very last day of applications, I decided to take a chance and put in my application in and luckily I was accepted.” The mother of three is now a primary school teacher and loves nurturing future leaders. She said teaching had always been her passion and she encouraged adults without a higher education to take that first step. #NatashaDietrich The 47-year-old mother of three says she always knew there was more to life - even while working as a cleaner at the University of the Western Cape.
