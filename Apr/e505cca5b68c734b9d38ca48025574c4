So, this site for instance will have both of those vaccines. Pfizer will be two doses and J&J one dose.” Mkhize said he was satisfied with the provincial plan: “I must say that I am happy with the plan. The plan is very well aligned with the national plan for national vaccination programme.” The vaccine rollout is set to begin in earnest on 17 May and this phase will run until mid-October.
