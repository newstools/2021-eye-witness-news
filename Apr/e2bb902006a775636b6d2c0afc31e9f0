JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has announced the appointment of 35 young people tasked with reviving the ANC Youth League (ANCYL). The ANC disbanded its youth league in 2018 after it failed to elect new leadership. Internal squabbles also affected its last national task team. Some members of the task team announced by secretary-general Ace Magashule on Thursday include former President Jacob Zuma's daughter Thuthukile Zuma, the late Jackson Mthembu’s spokesperson Nonceba Mohlauli and  Fees Must Fall leader Fasiah Hassan. The ANC’s 35-member Youth League National Task Team is being seen as an opportunity for the once-mighty structure to be reignited. Here's a look at some task team members: NONCEBA MHLAULI Mhlauli will lead the ANC Youth League task team as a convenor. She was the spokesperson to the late Jackson Mthembu, Ministry in the Presidency. Mhlauli also served as head of communications and spokesperson of the ANC Parliamentary Caucus (2017-2019) and ANC media liaison officer (2016 -2018). After being selected for the task team, Mhlauli was quoted as saying by TimesLive as saying, “Young people within the ANC have a right to self-determination, and they must exercise that right by being the people who build their own organisation,”. In 2020 Mhlauli was in the race for the presidency of the ANC Youth League alongside Collen Malatji, Tlangi Mogale,  Katlego Mamabolo, and Luzuko Bashman. FASIHA HASSAN Hassan was one of the student leaders of the 2015 Fees Must Fall movement and the  youngest member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (MPL). In 2019 she was awarded the International Student’s Prize. Hassan first became involved in student activism in 2013/2014 with Palestinian solidarity work, and she was the first woman chairperson of the Muslim Students’ Association. She and some Fees Must Fall leaders featured in the film Everything Must Fall by Rehad Desai. Ahead of the 2019 general elections, Hassan joined the ANC communication team. After the announcement of the task team, Hassan posted on Twitter that the real work of reviving the Youth League began now. The real work of reviving the YL branch by branch, block by block begins now.
