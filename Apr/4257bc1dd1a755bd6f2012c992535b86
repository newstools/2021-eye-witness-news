CAPE TOWN – Four people were arrested on Thursday night in connection with a mob attack in which seven people were killed in the Eastern Cape. One of the suspects is believed to be a local ward councillor in the Zingqolweni locality. In Wednesday evening's attack in Lady Frere, four men were set alight and their bodies were found in a field. Police later found the bodies of two more men hanging in a forest. One man managed to escape and was taken to hospital for treatment, but later died. “We live in a country that is governed by the rule of law and therefore we cannot allow lawlessness and anarchy to rule with impunity within our communities. Mob justice remains a serious offence and those who continue to engage in vigilante style activities must face the consequences of their actions,” Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga said on Wednesday.
