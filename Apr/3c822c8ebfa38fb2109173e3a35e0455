JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Health Department said that there were no faults reported with the fire hydrants at Charlotte Maxeke  Academic Hospital during the last inspection six months ago.

"The last inspection on file for Charlotte Maxeke was done last year in 2020 between October and November. And when they did that inspection, the hydrants were in good working condition, so something probably could have happened between then and now," said Gauteng Health's Motalatale Modiba.
