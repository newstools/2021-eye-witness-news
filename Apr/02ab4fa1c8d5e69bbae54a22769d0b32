JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Gwede Mantashe on Wednesday said the party had no influence on appointments in the judiciary but it encouraged members to apply for positions. He has testified at the state capture commission on Wednesday on the role of the ANC in parliamentary oversight. The commission started with deployment in government and state-owned entities. But he maintains that the party deployment committee only makes recommendations, and that it also wants to ensure that public servants don’t sabotage the party.
