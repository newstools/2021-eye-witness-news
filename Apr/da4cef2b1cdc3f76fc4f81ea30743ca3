"The Department of Health has procured 31 million vaccines from Johnson & Johnson. An initial agreement for 11 million was signed and the initial purchase price paid." Mkhize added that the nature of the non-disclosure agreements with manufacturers made it seem like his department was lax. "I can also assure you that we have not been sleeping on the job. The fact that we previously did not disclose before Parliament the blow-by-blow details of the intense negotiations is because we’re prioritising the closing of those agreements in order to secure vaccines we require for us to reach population immunity." He reiterated that the country was expecting 31 million vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson despite the suspension of the rollout to healthcare workers.
