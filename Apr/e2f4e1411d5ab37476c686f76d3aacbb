CAPE - The DA in the Eastern Cape legislature has called on Premier Oscar Mabuyane to declare the province a drought disaster area. Overall dam levels in the province are running critically low. The province has been experiencing a devastating drought since 2015. “Nelson Mandela Bay and Kouga municipality are literally months away from dry taps. The Kouga Dam is now only at 4.48% of the total capacity. "It is estimated that in two months no more water will be able to be extracted from it,” said Rural Development spokesperson Retief Odendaal.
