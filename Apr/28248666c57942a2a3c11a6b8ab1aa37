JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on Monday said it was aware of coordinated attempts to criminalise its leaders. This after the _Daily Sun _reported that EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi was being investigated for rape. The newspaper claims the report was based on a 23-year-old woman's affidavit. According to the article, the woman claims she was violated at an upmarket penthouse by a man who goes by the name of Quinton who she later discovered was Ndlozi. Ndlozi's middle name is Quinton, but he's told the paper it was a case of mistaken identity.

While police are not liberty to disclose or confirm identities of victims/complainants and suspects, we can further confirm that Dr Ndlozi is not a suspect in this case.” The EFF said it would support any legal action against the newspaper for deliberately defaming Ndlozi. The party added the crisis of gender-based violence and rape must never be used to fight political battles. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
