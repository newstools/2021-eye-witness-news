CAPE TOWN - The Melomed Hospital in Mitchells Plain is COVID-19 free as of Thursday. The facility discharged its last COVID-19 patients two days ago, but a child tested positive there earlier on Thursday. However, he too will be sent home, which means the hospital has no coronavirus cases to deal with. Melomed Mitchells Plain said being coronavirus free was a key milestone that could not go unnoticed. Doctor Terence Mudaly, a specialist physician at the hospital, said: “It’s definitely a monumental moment for us and we are ecstatic. It’s been quite a journey and we worked hard.” The facility's first COVID-19 patient was admitted on 19 April last year and since then, Mudaly has treated many more. “I have treated at least 400-500 [COVID] patients.” He said despite the positive development, staff were mindful of the threat of a third wave. “We are still taking the necessary precautions like we did when we had COVID patients being admitted.” WATCH: COVID-19: Our entrance into an age of pandemics  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
