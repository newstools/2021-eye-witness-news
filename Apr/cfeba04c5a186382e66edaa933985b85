The defence for the man believed to be the mastermind behind the murder of Tshegofatso Pule said their client was not a flight risk and therefore should be released on bail. Ntuthuko Shoba stands accused of conspiracy to commit murder among other charges. He was arrested after Muzikayise Malephane entered into a plea agreement with the State and implicated Shoba in the killing of Pule. The eight months pregnant woman was found hanging from a tree in Roodepoort last year.
