"The fire has now been contained with only sporadic flare-ups in the Deer Park area which pose no threat." Fire and Rescue Services' Jermaine Carelse said that they were now looking out for further hotspots. "The downscaling of resources started yesterday evening and only a few fire crews are currently monitoring the situation around UCT, Philip Kgosana Drive and Deer Park. The monitoring operations will continue throughout the week." After a hellish few days, gusting winds abated and fire crews were able to make headway against the blaze. At least 11 structures, including houses and a library at the University of Cape Town (UCT) were damaged or gutted in the disaster.
