DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa has used the 150th birthday celebration of the late Charlotte Maxeke to highlight issues that need to be addressed so the country can achieve gender equity. Maxeke is renowned for being the first black woman to graduate with a university degree in the country as well as being one of the founders of the Bantu Women’s League, which later became the African National Congress Women’s League. In an address delivered at the Fort Hare University in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday, Ramaphosa told those gathered that more work still needed to be done in order to avail more opportunities to women in a bid to fulfil work started by Maxeke.
