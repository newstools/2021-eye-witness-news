CAPE TOWN - Political analysts are on Tuesday struggling to see a future for Bonginkosi Madikizela within the Democratic Alliance (DA). He's already stepped down as the party's Western Cape leader after admitting he did not complete a Bcom degree, as stated on his CV. That expose, first reported in the Daily Maverick, led to his suspension as transport MEC and two investigations.
