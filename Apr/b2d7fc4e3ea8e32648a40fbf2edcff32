"He tried to get out because he also had a weapon on him. He tried to get out and shoot back, but it was in vain because he was hit. He jumped into the car again, wanting to take off. His daughter still shouted: "daddy, daddy, go!"But, it was too late. "His last words apparently were that he's trying but he can't...and then he died." It's believed Kube was either murdered for his gun, or that his death is linked to ongoing conflict in the taxi industry. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
