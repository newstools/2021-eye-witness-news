JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has dismissed a multiple application by counsel for former Minister Malusi Gigaba for testimony by his estranged wife norma Mngoma to be suppressed or for her to testify in camera. His representative Advocate Richard Solomon argued that Mngoma's evidence may not be credible as the couple is going through an acrimonious divorce. He also said the couple's children were mentioned in the letters addressed to the commission by Mngoma But Zondo ruled against all of this: “The application is dismissed. With regard to the alternative, which relates to Mrs Gigaba testifying in camera is also dismissed. The application for leave to cross-examine will be dealt with at some other stage.” Mngoma is expected to testify about Gigaba’s interactions with the Guptas and their visits to their residence.
