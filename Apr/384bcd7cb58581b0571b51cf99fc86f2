CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz on Sunday said the scourge of gender-based violence continues unabated and needs to be eradicated from society. This is in the wake of several suspected hate crimes against members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Several members of the LGBTQIA+ community have been attacked and killed across the country in recent weeks. Lonwaba Jack (22) is one of the victims. He was murdered on his birthday last Sunday. His body was found stabbed in the Nyanga East area. A 17-year-old suspect has been charged with the murder.

We need to eradicate gender-based violence in our society.” Click here to listen to the full #TheBrokenRainbow series Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
