The medical doctor became a household name through sharing her support and advice on Twitter, quickly gaining a large following. She was also a radio host on _Kaya FM _until recently. Her family said: “Sindi always offered support and great advice to educate those around her. Not only was she a beacon of love and light on her Kaya FM show _Sidebar with Sindi', _and all her social media platforms, but she genuinely loved and gave endlessly to all she knew with grace and kindness. She modelled the love and grace that she knew in Jesus.” South Africans rallied to raise money in recent days to cover medical doctor Van Zyl’s medical fees which had run into the millions.
