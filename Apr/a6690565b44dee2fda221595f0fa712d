CAPE TOWN - Police has implemented a 72-hour activation plan after three people were gunned down in Gqeberha on Friday. Two people were shot dead outside a bus ticket office after purchasing tickets to Gauteng. A bystander was also fatally shot by stray bullets as he left a supermarket on the premises. The five attackers fled the scene, but crashed their vehicle into a lamppost. Police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu: "All five occupants got out and ran in different directions. Anti-gang unit members, assisting by SAPS mounted police, spotted two males, both with firearms, running across Highfield Road chased after them and apprehended them in Peddie Street in Korsten. Firearms, a revolver and a 9mm pistol were recovered. The vehicle was reported as hijacked in Humewood earlier in the day." Three suspects remain at large.
