JOHANNESBURG - The count down to the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games just got real, with the South African Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc)  on Thursday announcing the first group of athletes to be representing Team South Africa at the sporting showpiece later this year. Sascoc announced representatives from across seven sporting codes namely athletics, climbing, cycling, gymnastics, hockey (men and women), sailing and surfing. Team SA plans to compete in 23 of the 33 Olympic sports and this is the first list of athletes who have been selected. Wayde van Niekerk, Caster Semenya and Jordy Smith, in athletics and surfing respectively are not on the list but Sascos said that they still had time to qualify to be added to the final list. Sascoc president Barry Hendricks congratulated the first team members to be selected: "After all the challenges the world at large faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the postponement of the Olympics, it’s a very exciting time for us as an Olympic Committee, and it feels incredible to be announcing our first names of Team South Africa. "Congratulations to the selected team members and all your resilience and hard work has paid off, and we strongly believe that the team will bring sporting pride to the whole of South Africa." With 57 days to go, athletes selected for the Tokyo Olympics have been receiving COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the Games which run from 23 July to 8 August.
