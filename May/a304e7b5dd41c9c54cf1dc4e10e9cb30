JOHANNESBURG - British & Irish Lions head coach, Warren Gatland, named his 37-man squad to tour South Africa for the 2021 Castle Lager Lions Series against World Champions Springboks. Alun Wyn Jones has been handed captaincy responsibilities for the Tour. As for the likes of Josh Adams, Bundee Aki, Chris Harris, Ali Price, Louis Rees-Zammit, Tadhg Beirne, Jack Conan, Zander Fagerson, Iain Henderson, Jonny Hill, Wyn Jones, Andrew Porter, Sam Simmonds, Rory Sutherland and Hamish Watson, they are debutants for the series. Speaking on Thursday, Gatland said of his team, “We believe we’ve picked a squad capable of winning a Test series in South Africa. Selecting a Lions squad is never easy, and, in many ways, this has been the most challenging selection I have been involved in. Over the course of the last three weeks the coaches and I have rigorously debated each position. We saw some outstanding performance in the recent Six Nations, so competition for places has been tough with some incredibly tight calls to make. He went on to add, “However, we are very happy with the squad we have assembled and look forward to meeting up in Jersey in just over a month’s time to start our preparation to take on the World Champions. We’ve left out some very talented players, which gives an indication to the strength of this squad and we know how important that stand-by list will be. Being selected for a Lions Tour is the greatest honour for a British and Irish player and I congratulate everyone named today.” British & Irish Lions squad Backs (16):Josh Adams (Cardiff, Wales) WingBundee Aki (Connacht Rugby, Ireland) CentreDan Biggar (Northampton Saints, Wales) Fly-halfElliot Daly (Saracens, England) CentreGareth Davies (Scarlets, Wales) Scrum-halfOwen Farrell (Saracens, England) Fly-halfChris Harris (Gloucester Rugby, Scotland) CentreRobbie Henshaw (Leinster Rugby, Ireland) CentreStuart Hogg (Exeter Chiefs, Scotland) Full-backConor Murray (Munster Rugby, Ireland) Scrum-halfAli Price (Glasgow Warriors, Scotland) Scrum-halfLouis Rees-Zammit (Gloucester Rugby, Wales) WingFinn Russell (Racing 92, Scotland) Fly-halfDuhan van der Merwe (Edinburgh Rugby, Scotland) WingAnthony Watson (Bath Rugby, England) WingLiam Williams (Scarlets, Wales) Full-back Forwards (21):Tadhg Beirne (Munster Rugby, Ireland) Second rowJack Conan (Leinster Rugby, Ireland) Back rowLuke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs, England) HookerTom Curry (Sale Sharks, England) Back rowZander Fagerson (Glasgow Warriors, Scotland) PropTaulupe Faletau (Bath Rugby, Wales) Back rowTadhg Furlong (Leinster Rugby, Ireland) PropJamie George (Saracens, England) HookerIain Henderson (Ulster Rugby, Ireland) Second rowJonny Hill (Exeter Chiefs, England) Second rowMaro Itoje (Saracens, England) Second rowAlun Wyn Jones (Ospreys, Wales) (Captain) Second rowWyn Jones (Scarlets, Wales) PropCourtney Lawes (Northampton Saints, England) Second rowKen Owens (Scarlets, Wales) HookerAndrew Porter (Leinster Rugby, Ireland) PropSam Simmonds (Exeter Chiefs, England)  Back rowRory Sutherland (Edinburgh Rugby, Scotland) PropJustin Tipuric (Ospreys, Wales) Back rowMako Vunipola (Saracens, England) PropHamish Watson (Edinburgh Rugby, Scotland) Back row
