READ: Magashule instructed to apologise to Ramaphosa for suspension letter The ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte described having to suspend Magashule as sad but she fiercely picked the ANC over her once ally, saying that the organsation came first. Duarte told journalists that Magashule’s suspension letter to Ramaphosa had to be retracted. "Firstly, this letter that suspends a sitting president, in the manner that it was done, could have had many repercussions and would have perhaps had repercussions - people started calling from other countries to verify."
