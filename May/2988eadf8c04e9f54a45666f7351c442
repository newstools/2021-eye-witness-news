JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has decided to lay another criminal complaint against former South African Airways (SAA) board chair Dudu Myeni. And he has directed that she should appear at 2 pm on Tuesday directly or via Zoom. Her lawyer advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi said Myeni was on standby to testify from the offices of her attorneys in Pietermaritzburg and she would put off her planned trip on a family engagement. Myeni was a no show at the commission and she wanted to apply for a postponement. Evidence leader advocate Kate Hofmeyr said she should not be allowed to defy Zondo like she did with Parliament when she was called but refused to appear in 2018. WATCH: Zondo commission to lay criminal complaint against Myeni for no-show  Zondo said it was unacceptable that she didn’t appear and she had no valid reason: “The commission must take steps to lay a criminal complaint with the South African Police Service against her for acting in breach of the summons and Commissions Act. I direct that she should make herself available to give evidence.” Hofmeyr said if this was true that she was on her way to attend a family function when she had been served with a summon, then she was showing clear disrespect for the commission. She is arguing that Myeni has committed a criminal offence by not appearing and she has taken the postponement for herself. “What happened in Parliament in 2018 should, with respect, not be repeated. There should be a criminal charge laid against Ms Myeni and regrettably, for the second time in this commission.” It’s not the first time the commission pursues criminal action against Myeni. During her testimony in November of last year, the former SAA board chair revealed the identity of a witness who was given anonymity for safety reasons. For this, the commission chair called for a police investigation into her conduct. WATCH LIVE: Dudu Myeni snubs Zondo Inquiry  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
