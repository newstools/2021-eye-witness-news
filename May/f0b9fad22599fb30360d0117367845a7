DURBAN - Former President Jacob Zuma  expected to plead not guilty when he returns to the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday. Zuma and French arms company Thales face corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering charges linked to the multibillion-rand arms deal. Last Monday, the matter was postponed to Wednesday after Zuma’s lawyers indicated an intention to file a special plea in terms of Section 106 of the Criminal Procedure Act. In court papers seen by Eyewitness News, Zuma has called for the removal of lead State prosecutor advocate Billy Downer from the case.

Zuma said this made Downer unable to conduct a “lawful prosecution” that would uphold his constitutional rights to a fair trial. But the State has rubbished Zuma’s contentions, calling them a “regurgitation of false claims” previously made by the former president. The Pietermaritzburg High Court is expected to issue its decision on Zuma’s Section 106 application on the matter after being addressed by both the defence and the State.
