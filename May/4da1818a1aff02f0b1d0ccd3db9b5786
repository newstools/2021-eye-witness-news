CAPE TOWN - As COVID-19 cases in India continue to multiply at an alarming level throughout the country, back home NGO Gift of the Givers is doing its bit to assist. The organisation said that the only decisive, effective, life-saving intervention currently was to supply oxygen to those already affected. The group's Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said that it would be partnering with organisations in India that were focusing on "home oxygen" to minimise patient overload at hospitals as most health facilities were already overrun and had neither beds nor adequate oxygen capacity. "There's a multi-pronged approach. India has oxygen, it has companies that have oxygen but there's a problem of distribution. They don't have enough oxygen tanks and nobody in the world has enough oxygen tanks given the crisis and the speed at which the virus has spread through the country." The first batch of oxygen concentrators  was purchased last night, in response to the alarming increase of #COVID19 cases in #India. #GiftOfTheGivers #MakeADifference #ForTheGreaterGood #Healthcare #Health #Coronavirus #COVID19inIndia #IndiaCOVIDCrisis pic.twitter.com/vOH7tbNhc0  UPDATE: The first 80 oxygen concentrators arrive at #GiftoftheGivers warehouse.
