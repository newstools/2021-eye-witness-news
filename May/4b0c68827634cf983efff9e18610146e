The NICD said if members of the public rapidly implemented meticulous social distancing and adhered to non-pharmaceutical measures, the third wave would be slowed down. The NICD's professor Adrian Puren said: “Wearing masks and keeping social distancing… the transmission will decline, and the third wave will be delayed.” The institute said there had been an increase in hospital admissions and COVID-19 related deaths had gone up by 18% in comparison to the past seven days with the Eastern Cape and Western Cape accounting for the majority of the fatalities. It said with the vaccination of the elderly expected to begin next week, delaying the third wave would provide more time to vaccinate those most at risk for severe diseases and would save lives.
