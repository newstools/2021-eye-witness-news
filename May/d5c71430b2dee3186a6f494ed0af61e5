CAPE TOWN - A traditional healer has encouraged others to take the COVID-19 vaccine amid apparent skepticism. Doctor Mavuso Nqola from Mfuleni received the Pfizer vaccine at the Khayelitsha District Hospital on Monday. The 39-year-old Nqola was paralysed after he was shot during a robbery at his shop in 2007. Following a three-month hospital stay and recovery, he devoted his life to community work and traditional healing. Nqola said that despite having his own remedies, he had opted to take the COVID-19 vaccine. "I was very worried when government said that the third wave was coming. I was not scared because I have medicine to heal the COVID but as a practicing traditional healer, we have an MOU with government, anything that government says, I have to do," Nqola explained. On day one of the public vaccine rollout, the Western Cape inoculated 939 people, the Eastern Cape over 1,600 and Limpopo 995. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
