"We also have a yellow level for rain resulting in flooding and structural damage for the City of Cape Town, Cape Winelands, the Garden Route district on Wednesday as well as on Thursday." The city's Disaster Risk Management spokesperson, Charlotte Powell: “The South African Weather Service has advised the Disaster Management Centre that an intense cold front will make a land fall on Wednesday. We remind residents to clear out any potential blockages around their homes. In low-lying areas, dig a trench around your home if possible, to allow water to run off and reduce the risk of localised flooding.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
