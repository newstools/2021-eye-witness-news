The city's Neo Goba said that there were doing everything they could to make sure that the residents were catered for. "The Department of Housing in the City of Joburg has procured mobile kitchens as most residents are not in a position to do their own cooking. Through the Social Development Department, we are reaching out to corporates that are willing to supply nutritional meals to those who don’t have the means to do so. The department has also started a process of looking for contractors for the new shacks with civil infrastructure,” Goba said.
