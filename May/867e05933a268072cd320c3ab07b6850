The biggest factor for the resurgence in South Africa is the ongoing transmission of the variant that was identified in South Africa since December 2020.” WATCH: Madhi - Third wave expected to be less severe  With South Africa playing catch up with its vaccination programme, Madhi said there was not enough information to tell whether the existing vaccines would be effective against the variant.
