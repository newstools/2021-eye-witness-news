JOHANNESBURG - Businessperson Kevin Wakeford said he had no influence in a decision by controversial facilities management company Bosasa to pay alleged bribes to Home Affairs consultant Aneel Rahadkhrishna. Wakeford was a turnaround advisor for then Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. He has denied allegations by former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi that he influenced Home Affairs and Sars dealings with the company -  even though it paid him R57,000  a month. Wakeford was supposed to help Home Affairs save money on the Lindela contract as then Minister Mapisa-Nqakula’s advisor.

Then they decided to pay him in instalments and in some instances he says instead of paying you, they paid him. And also other payments were made to his wife having rendered services. It all looks like money is being hidden, doesn't it?,” said the evidence leader. Agrizzi said Bosasa made more profit after their contract was renegotiated with Home Affairs. But Wakeford said Agrizzi was a liar and the department saved millions.  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
