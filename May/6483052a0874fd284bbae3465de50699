CAPE TOWN - Vaccine registration has been slow in the Western Cape. Only 27% of residents have registered on the Electronic Vaccine Data System. Phase 2 gets underway on Monday for people over the age of 60. Almost 720,000 Western Cape residents are older than 60 and therefore eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from Monday. However, Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said that so far, only around 194,000 had registered. "On Monday, the people who will be vaccinated for phase two are the older persons. We are starting in the metro. In the metro, there are about seven sites but it will be more at old age homes," the MEC explained. #COVID19vaccines Mbombo says 27% of people ( 719668 ) in the WC, eligible to receive vaccines from Monday have so far registered.
