JOHANNESBURG – Joburg Water said it was experiencing challenges at its Hursthill, Crosby and Brixton reservoirs due to a low inflow of water -affecting large parts of the City. Parts of Johannesburg – including Auckland Park, Northcliff and Westbury – have had little to no water for over two days now. The water shortage has also affected health facilities including Helen Joseph Hospital.

Spokesperson Eleanor Mavimbela said, “Our Hurstill reservoir is still running at very low levels because the in-flow into the reservoir has not increased at all. The reservoir is still under tremendous strain and is not coping with the demand for water; but the Brixton and Crosby reservoirs have improved quite a lot.” Mavimbela has apologised for the disruptions which have severely impacted patients at Helen Joseph Hospital since Thursday. It’s understood patients, out of desperation, have ordered litres of water – while good samaritans have started to donate water bottles. “We do have roaming waster tankers in areas as alternative water supply. We do apologise to all affected residents for this inconvenience.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
