Besides speaking on matters related to his budget, Minister Mkhize also issued a warning about COVID-19 variants. "Even though 95% of those infected have recovered, COVID-19 cases have started to rise significantly and we may find ourselves in a bad way. Of concern, is the emergence of the B.1.351 variant in our country and the importation of B.1.617.2 variant from India," Mkhize told MPs. He also came under heavy criticism from opposition parties who had rejected his department’s budget. Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Siviwe Gwarube said that healthcare workers were continuously being let down by government with regard to vaccinations. "To make matters worse three days from now we are expecting to rollout phase two of the vaccination programme in the country. This is all while 700,000 healthcare workers are yet to receive their jabs," Gwarube said.
