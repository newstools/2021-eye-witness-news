JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal will on Wednesday issue temporary suspensions against its members who are refusing to step aside. The party has confirmed that it will meet with those affected by the 2017 resolution on Wednesday afternoon. Rule 25.7 of the party’s constitution calls for the temporary suspension of members facing criminal charges. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule is the most senior member affected by the resolution, which he is challenging in the courts, while KZN deputy provincial chairperson Mike Mabuyakhulu has already stepped aside.
