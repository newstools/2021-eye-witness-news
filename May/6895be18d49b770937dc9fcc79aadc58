JOHANNESBURG - Former Eskom CEO Matshela Koko said the state capture commission must reject Mosilo Mothepu’s testimony that he was the lead negotiator for the McKinsey contract. Koko has returned to testify about his tenure at the power utility on Tuesday. He has previously denied any involvement or talking to Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa, who was instrumental in brokering the deal. The commission said McKinsey and Trillian were paid in excess of R1.6 billion. And Koko denied that he negotiated the deal: “And Mr Koko was never been involved in those negotiations, that’s the affidavit that came from McKinsey yesterday. The lead negotiator of those contracts said he negotiated and that I was never there.” WATCH LIVE: Ex-Eskom CEO Matshela Koko returns to state capture inquiry  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
