PIETERMARITZBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that former President Jacob Zuma was guaranteed a free and fair trial in the corruption case against him as per his constitutional rights. This comes amid calls by Zuma for the removal of lead State prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer, from the case, claiming that he was biased and associated with the Democratic Alliance (DA), a hostile political party. Zuma on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to allegations of corruption during the arms deal of the late 1990s.

NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema said that Zuma's claims had been previously dismissed by the courts. He said that the former statesman's rights would be protected during the trial.
