JOHANNESBURG – In a dramatic turn of events the state capture commission was forced to adjourn abruptly last night after Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was told there was a serious security threat. The commission sits at the old City of Joburg chamber, and Zondo said he would continue on Friday morning. However, he would wait to be advised if Norma Mngoma – the estranged wife of former Minister Malusi Gigaba – can testify in person or remotely.

When he returned, Zondo confirmed the hearing was adjourned for the day.

If we are left with an hour, I wonder if we can’t do that hour in the morning. I think we should still be able to come here unless we are advised differently.” The commission has not clarified what the threat was – but a statement on its Twitter account confirmed that it was security-related.
