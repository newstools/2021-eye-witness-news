JOHANNESBURG - ANC President Cyirl Ramaphosa has told the party’s caucus that issues brought up by embattled secretary general Ace Magashule in his own unauthorised attempt to suspend the party president are null and void. Ramaphosa, for the first time since Magashule penned his response to his suspension, took ANC members of Parliament into his confidence, telling them he was shocked and dismayed by its contents. Magashule, who has been suspended by the ANC, insists he remained the secretary-general as he has lodged an appeal with the party. He said the party’s 2017 resolution called for all those facing allegations of corruption to step aside and not just those facing corruption and serious charges. The secretary-general had refused to step aside over the past 30 days which led to his suspension.

The president, who was briefing the caucus on upcoming local government elections and the Zondo commission of inquiry, also used the opportunity to share his thoughts on the letter from a defiant Magashule. Sources say he told them the matters raised by Magashule had been dealt with by the integrity commission in the ANC and that the accounts before the courts were not in his control and were not criminal matters.
