DURBAN - Gauteng premier David Makhura said while he understood that Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu’s passing was a sad occasion for the Zulu nation, mourners must adhere to COVID-19 regulations as the country was still in a pandemic. The Queen passed away last week at a Johannesburg hospital, aged 65. She had apparently been battling ill-health since 2016. However, the exact cause of her death is not yet known. Makhura was part of the delegation transporting the Queen’s body from Gauteng to her Kwakhangelamankengane royal palace in Nongoma, Northern KwaZulu-Natal.

Earlier on Wednesday they gathered outside the Hillbrow mortuary in Johannesburg clad in traditional regalia and singing cultural songs. Makhura again extended his condolences to the Zulu royal family. “It is indeed sad that we have lost her majesty immediately after losing the king, but as I have said, all we as a people can do is to wish the Zulu royal house strength and resilience." The Queen is expected to be interred at midnight in a private ceremony attended by only close members of the Zulu and Swati royal families.
