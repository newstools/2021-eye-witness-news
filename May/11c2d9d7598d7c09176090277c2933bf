JOHANNESBURG - The EFF has joined growing calls for South Africa to implement a travel ban to and from India. The red berets, in a statement, accused the government of ignoring global trends and foresight to prevent potential devastation from hitting the country This is also in the wake of fears that the B.1.617 variant of COVID-19 first discovered in India might have already reached the country's shores. But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize allayed fears on Tuesday, saying the variant had not yet been detected.
