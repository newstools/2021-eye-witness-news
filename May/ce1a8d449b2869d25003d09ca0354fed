CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape is seeing experiencing a COVID-19 resurgence as cases are yet again going up. The provincial Health Department said that it was seeing, on average, 170 new infections a day and there had been a 39% week-on-week rise. Western Cape head of Health, Dr Keith Cloete, said that admissions and deaths were increasing slightly. Cloete said that this showed that there was a resurgence as there'd been a sustained increase for seven days in the number of new cases. "We have now officially gone into a resurgence. It's not quite the start of the third wave but is the early most sustained sign that we've had increased cases." In Cape Town, he said that most sub-districts were showing an increase. There were also increases in rural areas in the Cape Winelands, Garden Route and the West Coast. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
