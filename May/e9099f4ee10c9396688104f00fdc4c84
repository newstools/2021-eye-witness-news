JOHANNESBURG – Former Transnet chief financial officer (CFO) Anoj Singh has denied that Regiments sent him details of kickbacks that were paid to Gupta money laundering companies. The State Capture Commission showed him emails from Eric Wood requesting payments with attachments of Excel spreadsheets, a Singh left evidence leader advocate Anton Myburg in stitches when he said he didn’t know how to open the documents. “Documents that are attached would require that you physically do something to the spreadsheet to be able to access these. It’s called hidden data,” said Singh.
