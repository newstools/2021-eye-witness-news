Some said that they often waited as long as a year to receive funds. Other issues raised were the lack of staff at some offices. Barbara Beukes from De Doorns said that at the local office there were only three staff members who assisted a limited number of people, while others were turned away. "When we went there last week, there was no electricity. Why didn't they pay the electricity [bill]? Who's fault was that? There's only three people there." Danielle de Witt from the Commercial, Stevedoring, Agricultural and Allied Workers Union (CSAAWU) said that there was no assistance in Robertson at all but when officials were in the area, the services were poor and delayed. "If the people are coming there, they don't care. The people are getting dates, long dates and the people are struggling nand they don't get their money. So what must we do about that now?" The minister has indicated that his department would look at ways of addressing the issues. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
