DURBAN - Some African National Congress (ANC) branches in eThekwini have on Sunday called for the reinstatement of embattled ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, claiming the party’s step aside resolution has been unfairly implemented against him. Magashule was suspended by his party last week for failing to step aside after he was given 30 days as per the ANC’s resolution. He faces charges stemming from an asbestos roofing project during his tenure as premier of the Free State.

A number of branches have also pledged allegiance to former President Jacob Zuma, saying any attempt to arrest him for failing to appear before the state capture commission will be met with resistance.
