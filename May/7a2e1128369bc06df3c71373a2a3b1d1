The DDP'S Lily Hlophe said that they now wanted to use the study outcomes to lobby government to improve safety conditions for migrant traders in the city. She said that about 67% of migrant traders used in the study felt unprotected by police. They also revealed that they felt intimidated by law enforcement officials. “Some members of the police are the ones who harass them, they are the ones that take their papers. In fact there was one who said he was arrested and only got out after a month and still didn’t know why he was arrested,” said Hlophe. Hlophe said that multi-stakeholder programmes involving government, business and civil society was needed to root out crime against foreign nationals.
