CAPE TOWN - Police in Nqanqarhu have launched a manhunt for three suspects linked to a deadly farm attack. This comes after a 79-year-old farmer was shot and killed at his home at Highfield farm during the early hours of Sunday. The victim was with his wife at the time when three suspects broke into his home via a window. It's believed that the suspects could not gain entry to the couple's bedroom but subsequently fired shots via the bedroom's security gate, killing the elderly man. While a house robbery is being suspected, nothing appears to have been stolen. The police's Tembinkosi Kinana: "Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga has condemned the killing of the farmer and described it as an act of criminality. She has thus ordered a 72-hour activation plan to mobilise all the necessary resources for an effective investigation and possible arrest of the suspects."
