CAPE TOWN - Alleged crime underworld figure Nafiz Modack has been charged with allegedly ordering the assassination of Anti-Gang Unit detective Charl Kinnear. Modack appeared at the Blue Downs Regional Court on Friday morning alongside four co-accused - among them an Anti-Gang Unit Member on Friday. Modack - along with Ricardo Morgan - also faces charges for their alleged role in the attempted hit on defence attorney William Booth. Nafiz Modack now joins Zane Kilian as the accused charged in connection with the September murder of Kinnear. They face over 60 charges. In court on Friday, the defense for Modack, Kilian, Jacques Cronje, Ricardo Morgan and Ashley Tabisher complained about not having enough details of the State’s case to start a bail hearing.However, Morgan - a car salesman who also has possible links to Kinnear’s murder - has been released on R50,000 bail. Nicolette Kinnear was in court and said it was a gut-wrenching experience coming face-to-face with her husband’s alleged killers. “Generally, on a Friday it is difficult and I think as a family, you can say you want justice and people arrested but when you’re face-to-face with it, it’s a different ballgame.” The men will remain in separate prisons until their next court appearance on Monday.
