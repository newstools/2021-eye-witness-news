JOHANNESBURG - Healthcare workers queuing for their COVID-19 vaccines at the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg told Eyewitness News on Friday the process to get the jab has been confusing and frustrating. Some say they are being turned away even with valid vouchers. Similar scenes played out at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital on Thursday. The Sisonke vaccination program comes to a close this weekend. But all unvaccinated workers who have registered will still be able to receive their jab alongside the elderly from next week. There is still a snaking queue at the Milpark Hospital with very little social distancing.
