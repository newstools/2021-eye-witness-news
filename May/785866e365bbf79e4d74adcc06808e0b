JOHANNESBURG – The national executive committee (NEC) of the African National Congress (ANC) will this weekend likely endorse a list of names suggested by the national working committee (NWC) to head up its independent body overseeing appeals from the contentious step aside resolution. At least five ANC veterans have been listed by committee members. They will have to consider cases put before them by those affected by the 2017 step aside resolution, including embattled suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule. The affected members are facing corruption and other serious criminal charges.
