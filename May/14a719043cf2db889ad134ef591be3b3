JOHANNESBURG - After issuing a warning on Tuesday of a 'high probability' of load shedding at 'short notice', Eskom has confirmed that it will implement stage one power cuts from 5pm to 10pm on Wednesday. The power utility said that the power cuts were due to a shortage of generation capacity.

Another 2,200MW is unavailable due to planned maintenance. Eskom teams are hard at work to return more generators to service as soon as possible." The power utility said that further load shedding might be implemented during the week should it fail to return its generators back to service. #POWERALERT2Stage 1 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 tonight due to shortage of generation capacity pic.twitter.com/MUtfpR98xl  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
