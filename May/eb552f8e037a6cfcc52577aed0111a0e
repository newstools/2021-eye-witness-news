JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Provincial Command Council has raised concerns around the recent spike in the province's COVID-19 infections. The council, which gave an update on its response to the pandemic on Friday, said that the province had recorded a worrying surge in the number of new cases, with infections almost double the average number from last week. Gauteng has continued on its trajectory as the country's COVID-19 epicenter, recording more than 425,000 positive cases, while more than 10,000 people have succumbed to the virus so far. Committee chair, Dr Mary Kawonga, said that all Gauteng districts had seen an increase in the past week. "We have not reached the third wave threshold yet but we are very worried. The highest increases have been in Johannesburg, Tshwane and Sedibeng. So the number of cases are double the number of cases we saw Monday to Thursday last week. So, for example, Thursday last week we were sitting at just under 300, Thursday this week we're 688." Kawonga said that Emfuleni was approaching a third wave threshold after consistently recording the highest daily cases, every day for the past three weeks. "In the sub-districts that are reporting the highest number of cases are Johannesburg D, Tshwane 3 and Emfuleni in Sedibeng. Mfuleni is actually the most worrying area. It has had the highest number of new cases per day per week for three weeks. Actually, the numbers in that area are approaching the third wave threshold."
