The ANC in greater Johannesburg said that these results were a clear rejection of the Democratic Alliance (DA)-Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) administration, which it claimed nearly collapsed the city. The party also reclaimed a ward from the DA. The DA's fortunes did not turn in this round of by-elections, which saw the party lose four wards while it retained six. With over 300,000 people expected to have taken part in Wednesday’s polls, the IEC said that it recorded a 31.9% turnout. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
