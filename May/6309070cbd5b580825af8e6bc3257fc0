JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court has struck off the roll an application by Metrobus to interdict a strike by Demawusa. The bus company approached the court to stop employees affiliated to the union from demonstrating. Demawusa members abandoned their posts about three weeks ago, demanding wage increases among other related issues. The employer subsequently approached the court, arguing that it did not recognise the union. Over 30,000 commuters were inconvenienced because the striking employees were allegedly threatening other drivers going to work. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
