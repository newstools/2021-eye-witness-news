"The Western Cape inclusionary housing policy framework will provide clarity to Western Cape municipalities to adopt their own inclusionary housing policies. This is essential for the Western Cape and especially for the City of Cape Town to start to reverse centuries of exclusion and racial segregation where they do not have access to well-located affordable housing,” Ndifuna Ukwazi's Jonty Cogger said.
