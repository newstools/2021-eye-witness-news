JOHANNESBURG - The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) said that a probe into Health Minister Zweli Mkhize's close associates who allegedly benefited from COVID-19 contracts was at an advanced stage. The investigation was looking into how Mkhize's longtime personal assistant, Tahera Mather and a close associate, Naadhira Mitha, allegedly benefitted from COVID-19 contracts worth R82 million issued by the Health Department.

SIU head Andy Mothibi said that they would take action against anyone found to have broken the law. "Where there's a need for consequence management in the department, we will refer those to the director-general, where there's a need for prosecution, I will refer it to the National Prosecuting Authority and where there's a need for any action against anyone else at any level, including the executive authority, we will do so." The Daily Maverick has also revealed another explosive report that Mather and Mitha, and other parties, pocketed roughly R90 million in suspicious payments from a R150 million COVID-19 and national health insurance communications contract. The minister has yet to respond to the latest report. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
