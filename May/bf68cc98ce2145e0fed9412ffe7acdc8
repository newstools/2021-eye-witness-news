Mabuza said the reason the roll out had been slow to pick up was setbacks like the suspension in using the Johnson & Johnson jab, which has since been lifted. Mabuza was answering questions in the National Assembly on Wednesday. South Africa’s vaccine roll out has seen only about 26% of the 1.5 million healthcare workers being inoculated so far.
