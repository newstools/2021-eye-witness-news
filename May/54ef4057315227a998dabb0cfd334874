NONGOMA – The memorial service of the late amaZulu Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, which took place on Friday morning, was attended by high-profile guests, including former President Jacob Zuma. Dozens of mourners arrived at the Royal Palace in Nongoma, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, to pay their last respects to the late queen. She died last week at a Johannesburg hospital at the age of 65. Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu was interred in a private ceremony attended by only close members of the Swati and Zulu royal families. Three Zulu regiments of women (Isiphiphithi), men (Amabutho) and maidens (Amatshitshi) gathered at the Khangelamankengane Royal Palace.

In whatever she did, she did move towards Western life. We have learned a lot from Mama Mantfombi, that is why I am saying this is a celebration of her life.” Queen Mantfombi had served as regent of the Zulu nation for less than a month before her passing. The Zulu royal family described the late queen as humble and loving to all who came into contact with her. Her son Prince Simingaye said his mother was being remembered for her role in reviving African culture. Queen Mantfombi was married to King Goodwill Zwelithini in 1977 and together they had eight children.  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
