JOHANNESBURG - Dozens of Metrobus drivers are picketing at Gandhi Square in central Johannesburg on Monday as their strike enters its second week. Employees affiliated to Demawusa were demanding, among other things, an 18% wage hike. The bus company said that it was not prepared to negotiate with a union it did not recognise.

But now they said we should suspend the strike if we want to talk to them. We refused to end the strike,” said one of the striking workers. Workers were adamant that their strike would continue until their demands were met. Metrobus has since suspended all of its operations due to intimidation of non-striking workers.
