JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Basic Education (DBE) on Saturday said violence in schools was a problem and bullying was not a solution. The nationwide anti-bullying campaign kicked off in Orange Farm on Friday ahead Of Child Protection Week, which runs from 31 May to 7 June, aimed at preventing the violent cycle of bullying in schools. The departments’ intention is to raise awareness on bullying that has become increasingly evident in South African schools. Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said this campaign was also to urge victims of bullying to report their perpetrators. “So we are saying that young people must stop bullying and we are also appealing to the bullies that violence is not a solution to any problem.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
