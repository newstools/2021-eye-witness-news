Earlier on Friday Eyewitness News reported that two applications relating to the will of the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini had been consolidated into one and the matter had been temporarily taken off the Pietermaritzburg High Court roll. In court papers seen by Eyewitness News, the king’s first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini argued that she was entitled to 50% of the king’s assets and the will overlooked this despite being married in community of property. Another application filed by the queen’s daughters argued that the king’s will was forged and a review was required. But senior royal family members – including Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi - have endorsed the will which was read out shortly after the Zulu monarch’s passing and appointed Queen Mantfombi as regent of the Zulu nation.
