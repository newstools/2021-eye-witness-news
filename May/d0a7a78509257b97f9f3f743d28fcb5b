Earlier, one member kicked the ANC's Pemmy Majodina. Some members managed to intervene, with many then shouting out: “You can't hit a woman.” But there were cries for help when fists started to fly. The rotation of leaders seems to be the main issue under dispute, with Malema also among the members arguing. Some members are against such a system, with many shouting: “No rotation, no election.” Leader of the South African delegation Amos Masondo has called for calm. “It’s disappointing that at this critical point in time, there are these differences and the temperatures have gone a bit high.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
