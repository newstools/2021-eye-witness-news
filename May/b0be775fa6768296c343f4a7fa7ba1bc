NONGOMA - Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu's lawyer, Advocate Griffiths Madonsela, said that most members of the Zulu royal family were aggrieved by an attempt to question the queen's will during its reading at the Khangelamankengane royal palace on Friday night. A heated exchange occurred between Prince Thokozani Zulu and prime minister to the Zulu nation and monarch, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, during the reading of the will.

Armed members of Prince Misuzulu's security team whisked him away from the Khangelamankengane royal palace in a frenzy during an argument between Prince Buthelezi and Prince Zulu. Prince Zulu was among a group of royals who have previously accused Prince Buthelezi of excluding them from key family discussions.

"The meeting was not for anyone to oppose, it was just to get the clarity of the will. Actually, today we know who the king is." While the queen has left the throne to her eldest son Prince Misuzulu Zulu, she has declared that all her assets must be shared equally among her children.
