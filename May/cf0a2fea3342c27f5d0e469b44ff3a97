JOHANNESBURG - Public sector trade unions and government representatives are meeting at the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council on Monday afternoon. This follows a request from government over the weekend that the gathering be convened following a deadlock of this year’s public service wage negotiations over a week ago. READ: Talk of 'political meeting' to end deadlocked public sector wage negotiations Organised labour leaders are hoping that government will table a new wage offer for workers. Some have told Eyewitness News of the stress that a strike would place on public servants, who just last month were angered by deductions from their salaries for taking part in last year’s one-day protests. In an effort to cut the public wage bill, government resorted to offering workers 0% wage increases for the 2021-2022 financial year. The employer has also rejected other demands, including risk allowance and housing subsidy increases. Workers are demanding 7% wage hikes. While it is unlikely that government will deliver on this specific figure, union leaders who spoke to Eyewitness News said a movement from the 0% would be a step in the right direction.
