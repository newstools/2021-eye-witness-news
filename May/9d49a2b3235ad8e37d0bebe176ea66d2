CAPE TOWN – While there have been calls for a Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor who is accused of fraud and money laundering to step down, the City of Cape Town on Thursday said it was working with authorities to recover unspent funds. Table View councillor Nora Grose appeared in court on Thursday after she handed herself over to the Hawks. She stands accused of siphoning off money from humanitarian funds for food parcels by allegedly colluding on the Temporary Employee Relief Scheme with Reuben Swartz, the chairperson of the South African Religious Civic Organisation. Grose, who serves as the Sub Council Chairperson in Atlantis, was charged with fraud and money laundering involving R170,000 in humanitarian funds meant for the distribution of food parcels in Atlantis.
