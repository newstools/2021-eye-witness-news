JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC)’s national working committee (NWC) has opted to engage suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule, quashing talks of an expulsion. But Eyewitness News understands from NWC insiders that both Magashule and national executive committee (NEC) member Tony Yengeni will also be investigated for misconduct. This after the two were accused of sowing divisions outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court last week. Magashule, who is taking the ANC to court, has been suspended for refusing to step aside, this is over corruption charges against him.
