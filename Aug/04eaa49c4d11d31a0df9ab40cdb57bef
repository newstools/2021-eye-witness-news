Styan notes that other municipalities are paying their bills. “We’re very pleased to note that 26 of our municipalities are in good standing with Eskom He said when it came to bulk water services, the Overberg Water Board was the only Water Board within the province and there was currently no arrear debt owed by any municipality.
