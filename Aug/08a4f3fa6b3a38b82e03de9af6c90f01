Mokgoro insists he is not refusing to step down, instead, Eyewitness News understands the premier has accused the committee of treating him unfairly and making public pronouncements on his job without engaging with him first. On Tuesday, IPC coordinator Hlomane Chauke battled to explain Mokgoro’s whereabouts and whether the 73-year-old had submitted a resignation. Eyewitness News understands Mokgoro has now been tasked with preparing a hand over report. Maape, who is likely to replace him, has to be added on the ANC’s amended reserve list, which will be submitted to the legislature and gazetted after which he will be voted for through secret ballot to replace Mokgoro. Opposition parties have largely rejected this move, pinning it down to ANC factionalism. Eyewitness News also understands Mokgoro himself took an exception to Chauke’s handling of the saga for which ANC leaders have apologised.
