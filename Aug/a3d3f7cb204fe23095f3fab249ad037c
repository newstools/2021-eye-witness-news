CAPE TOWN – Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said his department hoped to clear the massive driving licence backlog by next year March. On Friday, the minister extended the deadline for driving licence renewals to 31 March 2022. One point two (1.2) million licences have not yet been renewed out of 2.8 million expired licences countrywide. “The challenge is not with the motorists, so you can’t be arrested and be given a fine simply because you have been failed by the system, so we are intervening to extend,” Mbalula said.
