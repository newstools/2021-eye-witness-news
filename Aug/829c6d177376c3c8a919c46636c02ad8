He would instead, take their id numbers and the travellers would receive a message from the lab a day or two later indicating that they have tested negative for the virus. The suspect sold a certificate for R500 hundred. Officials said preliminary investigations show that the suspect is not working alone, and more arrests will be made soon. The police's Lucky Sindane said, "The suspect allegedly charged R500 per certificate, without conducting the actual PCR test. The country is trying to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and we have such people who are sabotaging our efforts as a country. The suspect is expected to appear in the Booysens Magistrates Court on Monday." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
