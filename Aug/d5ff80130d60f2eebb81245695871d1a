CAPE TOWN - A Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality employee arrested for tender fraud has been released on bail. Admin clerk, Adele Majal, appeared in the Gqeberha New Law Court on Thursday for allegations of fraud, corruption and money laundering. Last month seven people and three company directors were arrested and appeared in court - they were released on bail. The woman was apparently ill when her accomplices were arrested. Hawks spokesperson Yolisa Mgolodela said: “The arrests are as a result of a tender that is alleged to have been awarded fraudulently to the undeserving Milonga Consultancy to do environmental impact analysis of which it was not competent for. Later payments were effected for work that was not performed.” It’s alleged that they defrauded the municipality out of R26 million rand. They are all set to appear in court again in January next year. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
