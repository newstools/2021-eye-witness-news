JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police have launched an investigation into a video showing two officers manhandling a schoolgirl in the West Rand. Officials have confirmed that the incident took place in the Krugersdorp CBD on Tuesday. In the video footage, which emerged on social media a police officer is seen dragging an 18-year-old school pupil in uniform on the pavement towards a vehicle.
