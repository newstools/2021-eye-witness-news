JOHANNESBURG – The Sunday Times has reported that the former director-general of the State Security Agency (SSA) Sonto Kudjoe is under investigation by the Hawks for alleged theft and/or corruption to the tune of R112 million in temporary advances. Kudjoe, who now works as the country's secretary for defense, faces claims that she and a handful of people who worked in her office created what appears to have been phantom operations that required large sums of cash. It's alleged that these were ordered by her personal assistant or office manager. The SSA opened a case against Kudjoe following concerns about the legitimacy of the operations and what appeared to be a pattern of abuse. This was after the agency noticed that there was almost non-existent proof of the operations. Eyewitness News approached the Hawks for comment, and the investigation unit's spokesperson Katlego Mogale confirmed that a case has been opened. "The directorate for priority crime investigation can confirm that a case was registered at Lyttleton Saps and transferred to the national serious corruption investigation for further probe. As and when evidence important to the investigation is concluded, only then will we effect the arrest, and those who are alleged to be involved have their identities known as and when they appear before the court." The publication further reports that, according to a highly placed source, Kudjoe's top-secret security clearance for the job as secretary of defense was turned down because of the criminal case against her.
