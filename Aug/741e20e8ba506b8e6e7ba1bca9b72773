JOHANNESBURG - The Special Tribunal is seized with arguments on the merits of former Gauteng Health Department chief financial officer, Kabelo Lehloenya’s, third party notice seeking to entangle Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the provincial government into the matter against her. The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has filed an application in the Special Tribunal against Lehloenya and former Gauteng Health HOD, Mkhululi Lukhele, seeking to recover monies allegedly paid to PPE service providers unlawfully. Lehloenya and Lukhele were in the employ of the department when the multi-billion rand contracts, many of them fraudulent, were issued to several companies at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.

He also dismissed Lehloenya's inclusion of Lukhele in her third-party notice. Both Lehloenya and Lukhele resigned from the department last year.
