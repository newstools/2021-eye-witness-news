JOHANNESBURG - Game has become the first retail store in South Africa to offer incentives to those who have been vaccinated. Residents who produce a vaccine card and ID at a till point will be able to claim 10% discounts from next week Wednesday. That includes anyone who has been fully vaccinated or received a single dose of their COVID-19 vaccination. The retail giant has started a campaign called Vax Appreciation Wednesdays, which will start on the 18 of August and run until 15 September. In a statement, Game's marketing president Katherine Madley said the initiative was to thank South Africans for their role in keeping their stores and the country safe. Madley said they saw first-hand the effects COVID-19 had on its customer’s pockets and lifestyle and aimed to support South Africa and its people to recovery from the economic blow.
