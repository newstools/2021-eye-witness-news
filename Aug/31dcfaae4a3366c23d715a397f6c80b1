The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Mangaung on Saturday raised concerns over the ANC's mayoral elect, saying it was just an extension of state capture projects started by former Free State premier and suspended party secretary general Ace Magashule.

The date for the election of the new mayor would be announced soon. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
