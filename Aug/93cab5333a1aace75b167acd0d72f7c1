JOHANNESBURG – Eskom said it may be forced to implement load shedding at short notice should further generating capacity losses occur. The utility has asked the public to reduce the usage of electricity as the power system is under severe pressure following the loss of four generating units since Thursday morning. A unit each at the Tutuka, Medupi and Majuba power stations tripped, while a unit at Lethabo has been taken offline to repair a boiler tube leak. Eskom said while the system was currently performing relatively well, a further loss of generation capacity would force it to implement load shedding at short notice, particularly between 6 pm and 9 pm on Thursday. #POWERALERT1Eskom may be forced to implement loadshedding at short notice should further generating capacity losses occur@SABCNews@eNCA @ewnupdates @News24 @Newzroom405 @TimesLIVE @IOL @Moneyweb @EngNewsZA @SowetanLIVE @mailandguardian @TheSAnews pic.twitter.com/Mxdg1SKPJo  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
