JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is planning to march to Phoenix, north of Durban, on Thursday and the Democratic Alliance (DA) is worried that this could inflame racial tensions in the area. The EFF has called on members to join what they’ve dubbed "a march to Phoenix against racist Indians". The DA has written to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), asking it to intervene, warning that the situation will escalate. This follows deadly violence in the area last month during the looting spree in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.

The EFF's Vusi Khoza has defended the party's demonstration. "We want to send a very clear message in Phoenix that we will never tolerate no-go areas where half of the people cannot walk freely because they are going to be shot."
