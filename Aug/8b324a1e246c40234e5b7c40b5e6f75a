She said that these were common and included headaches, a fever or chills. "They are the mild or minor ones. So they don't pose a potential risk and it is fine after the body's immune response." But people should not assume that all reactions were due to the vaccine. "There are many conditions, diseases happening at the same time, so you could be incubating another infectious disease at the same that you are being vaccinated," Meyer said. Meyer said that if the minor events did not subside within the first two to three days or if it became more severe, people needed to seek medical assistance.
