CAPE TOWN - The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday said it would go to court to oppose the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) bid to have the local government elections postponed from October to February next year. The IEC filed papers at the Constitutional Court last week, saying conditions under the COVID-19 pandemic were not conducive to being free and fair.

She has outlined the party’s legal action against the IEC’s Constitutional Court application. Zille said an election was not like a braai that could simply be postponed because of bad weather. She said regular, free and fair elections were part of the foundational clauses of the Constitution and as such would require a super-majority of 75% in Parliament to be amended.
