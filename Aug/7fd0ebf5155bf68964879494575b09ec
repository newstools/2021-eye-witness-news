JOHANNESBURG - The man arrested for the murder of Nosicelo Mtebeni has chosen not to apply for bail. Alutha Pasile made his first appearance in the East London Magistrates Court on Monday morning after he was arrested last week for allegedly killing the University of Fort Hare student. Parts of Mtebeni's dismembered body were found in a bag in the suburb of Quigney, while the rest was discovered at Pasile's residence. Pasile (25) and 23-year-old Mtebeni are believed to have been a couple. He will appear in court again on 28 September. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
