CAPE TOWN - From Friday, all adults will be eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Cabinet has now approved the inoculation of those aged 18 to 34. That cohort was initially set down for registration and vaccination from next month. The move is aimed to increase vaccine uptake following a slow down recently. Cabinet said more than nine million vaccines had been administered and over four million South Africans had been fully inoculated. Cabinet has also stressed that scientific evidence confirms that vaccinated people stand a better chance of surviving COVID-19, adding it's important to dispel unfounded and misleading conspiracy theories about inoculation. Ministers have further approved a decision to keep the country under the Risk-Adjusted Alert Level 3 of the national lockdown as advised by the ministerial advisory committee.
