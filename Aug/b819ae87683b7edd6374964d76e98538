CAPE TOWN - The trial of a former Zambian football coach will be heard at the Gqeberha Regional Court over the next two days. The 51-year-old man allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at a sports stadium in Gqeberha in December. He is currently out on R10,000 bail. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)'s Anelisa Ngcakani said: “The trial was supposed to start in May. However, he failed to appear in court, due to alleged challenges in acquiring a South African visa. He is accused of sexually assaulting a 39-year-old woman, during the Cosafa games and Gqeberha.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
