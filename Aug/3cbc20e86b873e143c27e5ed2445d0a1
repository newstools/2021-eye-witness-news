JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala on Friday said he was confident investors would remain in the province despite security fears following last month's civil unrest. KwaZulu-Natal was the epicentre of violence and deadly looting that claimed over 300 lives. Since then, provincial authorities have been overwhelmed with pressure to rebuild broken social relations, including public and private infrastructure amounting to over R45 billion.
