CAPE TOWN - An Eastern Cape mother will be sentenced on Thursday for killing her children. The Dimbaza woman suffocated her two sons in September last year. They were 1 and 6-years-old. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said before the murder, the accused told her older son she was going to kill him and his brother. The child apparently pleaded for his life but the woman prayed and suffocated the boys with plastic bags. She was found guilty last month.
