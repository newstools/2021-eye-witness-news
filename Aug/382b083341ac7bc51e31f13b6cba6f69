He is to appear at Adelaide Magistrates Court,” the police's Siphokazi Mawisa. Authorities said perpetrators involved in incidents of gender-based violence and femicide must face the full might of the law. “Gender-based violence is a priority and a huge concern for the SAPS, therefore every effort must be made to arrest suspects and place them behind bars,” she said.
