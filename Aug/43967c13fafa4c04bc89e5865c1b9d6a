JOHANNESBURG - Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who is expected to be confirmed as the new National Assembly Speaker on Thursday, is reportedly under investigation for corruption. According to News24, she allegedly received a R5 million bribe from a defence contractor and blew R7 million on aircraft charters while living it up at luxury hotels. It is being reported that Parliament's joint standing committee on Defence appointed a task team to investigate the allegations against her two months ago. At the time, Mapisa-Nqakula, whom President Cyril Ramaphosa removed from his Cabinet earlier this month, was minister of Defence and Military Veterans.
