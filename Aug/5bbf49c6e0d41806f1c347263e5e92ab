Coming from the background of tough and disrupted preparation programmes and competitions, we are beyond words to describe this achievement" said the president of Athletics South Africa, James Moloi. “The sheer determination of this team is reflected in the number of athletes that reached semifinals and the final. This has been a team effort, where those who didn’t go through the next stage in their events, continued to support their teammates throughout the competition. That is patriotism in the true spirit of sportsmanship.” The SA women's 4x100m relay team finished sixth in the final, with Marione Fourie, Charlize Eilerd, Kayla la Grange and Viwe Jinqi clocking 45.05 to break the national U20 record of 45.07 which had been set by the Northern Transvaal (Gauteng North) provincial team in Tshwane in March 1984.
