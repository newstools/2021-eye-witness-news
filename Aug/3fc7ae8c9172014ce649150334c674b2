JOHANNESBURG - As former President Jacob Zuma is due to appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court in person on Tuesday, his son Duduzane is once again suggesting that his father won't get a fair hearing. The case was due to be heard virtually, but Zuma's legal team argued that would violate his rights to a fair trial. The convicted criminal's son made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with the SABC on Sunday. Jacob Zuma has been in and out court for more than a decade. On Tuesday, his lawyers are expected argue for his special plea application. But his son Duduzane has lost all hope and faith in the judiciary: “I always prepare myself for the worst. I don’t have my hopes high when it comes to legal matters. The decisions will be made by the people who make those decisions.” Zuma is currently serving a 15-month jail term, at the Escort Correctional Services centre in KwaZulu-Natal, for contempt of court for failing to appear before the state capture commission of inquiry. He was also admitted to hospital last week for a medical check-up. Meanwhile, the former president's son revealed he has begun the processes in KZN to contest in the ANC leadership at the next national conference.
