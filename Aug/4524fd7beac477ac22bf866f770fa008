JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Education Department said that its systems were now up and running after a brief shutdown for maintenance. Earlier, the department announced a disruption to the 2022 online admissions process for the next 48 hours to try and fix the system. This resulted in parents and guardians applying under the current phase 1 application period not being able to access the website. The department has apologised for the inconvenience.
