CAPE TOWN – Brett Herron has been announced as the Good Party's mayoral candidate for the city of Cape Town ahead of the upcoming local government elections. Good Party leader, Patricia de Lille made the announcement at a press conference held in the Mother City on Sunday afternoon. “I am very grateful to announce that Brett Herron will be our mayoral candidate for the city of Cape Town. We have unfinished business in the City of Cape Town, and there is nobody more qualified with the experience and the passion like Brett Herron.” Herron said he's honoured and ready for the 27 October polls. “I thank you for this nomination. Let’s begin this good fight.” De Lille said she and her party had "unfinished business" in the city and there was plenty of work to be done. She added GOOD had made major strides more than two years after it was formed. "It's all systems go for the 2021 elections. We are ready. We will put up a good fight." De Lille said Herron was the right person to contest the race for the mother city's top job: "We want to attend to the unfinished business in Cape Town that we left behind two years ago. Brett is an experienced local government operator. He's a lawyer, who served with me and the City of Cape Town for eight years." Herron said restoring the city's ailing public transport system, and ensuring affordable housing will be key focus areas: "We will use the city's massive cash surpluses. I think they've got R19 billion currently in the bank to rollout large scale programmes to build, repair and maintain critical infrastructure, and this will create jobs." #LocalGovernmentElections Brett Herron has been announced as the GOOD partys mayoral candidate for Cape Town, in this years upcoming local government elections.
