Reiterating Ramaphosa’s testimony to Eyewitness News, Duarte said that the ANC never discussed the suspensions or inquiry which was set to follow. She also said that Zuma created a situation that should never happen. "My immediate response is but why sit with people outside and make a decision like that? When it hits the fan, you're on your own and those people disappear and can defend themselves. You can't."
