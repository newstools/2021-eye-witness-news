JOHANNESBURG - The latest unemployment figures are being described as depressing, with economists saying that a performance boost in certain industries will go a long way in turning the situation around. On Tuesday, Stats SA released the Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the second quarter of 2021, which showed that unemployment rose to a record high of 34.4%. South Africa now has the highest unemployment rate in the world, with economist Mike Schussler saying this is a huge problem. “It is a big sign of a depression, there's no country in the world that continuously in the last 27 years has had such a high unemployment rate,” Schussler said. Economist Chifipa Mhango said that government needed to start implementing some of its economic recovery plans as a matter of urgency. “A key element, which we'll be advocating for, is the infrastructure recovery plan,” Mhango said. Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke said that 11.9 million people in South Africa now formed part of the expanded definition of unemployment.
