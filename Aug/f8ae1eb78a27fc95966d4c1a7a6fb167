JOHANNESBURG - Team South Africa snatched four more medals at the World Athletics U20 Championships in Kenya on Saturday. Mine de Klerk led from the front as she won the women's shot put final, winning gold with a best attempt of 17.40m. It was her second medal at the Championships after she grabbed silver in the discus throw on Friday. Speaking to Jess Whittington for World Athletics, Mine de Klerk said   “It’s overwhelming, I still can’t believe it’s true.” “I definitely wanted to win a medal in the shot put, gold was my goal. In the discus, I didn’t expect to get a medal at all. I just came to enjoy it. When I got the silver I was blown away,” said the 18-year-old followed her opening 17.30m with throws of 17.24m, 16.77m, 17.15m, a foul, and then 17.40m. Fellow South African and 2018 African Youth Games champion  Dane Roets wrapped up an impressive SA double by taking bronze in the shot put with a 15.61m heave, while Pinar Akyol of Turkery earned silver (16.72m). Theirs were two of South Africa’s eight medals claimed so far at the World Athletics U20 Championships in Nairobi.

Though he missed out on the podium, Lythe Pillay also set a career-best (45.53) to finish fourth in the one-lap sprint. Anthony Pesela of Botswana won gold in 44.58. “I never expected to claim bronze, going by the tough opponents I was up against,” Nortje said. “My compatriot Pillay was the favourite by far, given the kind of experience he has had this season. I will take a few weeks off to reflect on the season.” Fellow sprinter, Sinesipho Dambile, snatched bronze to round off the country’s 4th medal in the men's 200m final. Dambile set a season's best of 20.48 to finish third in a race won by Nigerian athlete Udodi Chudi Onwuzurike in 20.21. “It was a pretty good race and I'm happy I won this bronze medal for my brother who died in a road accident last year. I dedicate it to him,” Dambile said. “I also didn't have good preparations because of a nagging injury, but now I'm ok. I will go back home and train for next year's World Athletics Championships in Eugene.” Anthony Pesela  wins the mens #WorldAthleticsU20 400m title in a championship record 44.58.Mexicos Luis Avils Ferreiro  sets a national U20 record for silver. pic.twitter.com/mS5TIqgCNh  In the women's 400m final, Precious Molepo ended fifth in 53.98, with Imaobong Nse Uko of Nigeria securing victory in 51.55.
