JOHANNESBURG - Newly appointed Health Minister, Joe Phaahla, will hit the ground running, as he is expected to address the weekly COVID-19 media update on Friday. Phaahla replaces Zweli Mkhize, who resigned at the eleventh hour after he was implicated in the R150 million Digital Vibes scandal. IN FULL: Ramaphosa's Cabinet reshuffle address Seen as quiet, reserved and usually operating behind the scenes, Phaahla is now thrust into the spotlight to direct the country's response to COVID-19. Ramaphosa chose a steady hand with extensive experience - Phaahla was Limpopo's first Health and Social Development MEC post-apartheid.   A medical doctor by profession, he has also served as deputy Health Minister for seven years. His biggest challenge is accelerating the vaccination programme ahead of a looming fourth wave. He also has to stabilise the deparment and clean up in the aftermath of a corruption scandal that has not only implicated his predecessor but other senior officials.
