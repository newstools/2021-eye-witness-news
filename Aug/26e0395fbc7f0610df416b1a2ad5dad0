JOHANNESBURG - The Jacob Zuma Foundation said there was nothing alarming about the former president's hospitalisation on Friday morning, confirming that it was a routine check-up, which was scheduled months in advance. The Department of Correctional Services confirmed on Friday that Zuma was at a facility outside the Estcourt Correctional Centre where he is serving his 15-month jail term. In June, the Constitutional Court found the former president guilty of contempt of court over his refusal to co-operate with the state capture inquiry that he set up. Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi said the former president's hospitalisation was a scheduled check-up. “People should not be alarmed as if he woke up this morning and he was rushed to hospital, it was a date known beforehand.” When asked which facility he is receiving medical care, Manyi said: “I can assure you, it’s not Russia, it’s not Cuba, it’s a hospital in South Africa. Correctional service knows the details but for security reasons, it will be totally irresponsible to divulge that.” As a prisoner, Zuma is always accompanied by a correctional services official when he is given special permission to leave the Estcourt Correctional Centre.
