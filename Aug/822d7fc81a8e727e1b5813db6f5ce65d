BLOEMFONTEIN - Security has been heightened around the High Court in Bloemfontein ahead of suspended African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule’s appearance on Wednesday morning. Magashule and 10 others are facing more than 70 charges of fraud relating to the controversial asbestos project, which never materialised. Members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) have been stationed here as part of the security contingent.

All the entrances leading to the court have also been closed. The pre-trial hearing proceedings are expected to begin at about 10AM. Previously, Magashule supporters arrived here en mass, defying COVID-19 safety and health protocols. But this time around, well-known Magashule supporter and suspended ANC member, Carl Niehaus, said that they would follow the rules. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
