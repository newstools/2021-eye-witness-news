CAPE TOWN - It seems that South Africans between the ages of 18 and 34 aren't wasting any time in getting their COVID-19 jabs. Those in this age group can now be vaccinated after the country's inoculation campaign was further opened on Friday. South Africa has reached the 10 million vaccine doses milestone since the vaccination programme was launched back in February. "I'm really excited. I've been waiting for this since March 2020," one person said. "We need to end this COVID thing," another said. "I've got plans for travel so I think it's great," one keen person explained. #COVID19SA Hundreds of people in the 18 to 34 cohort have already lined up at the CTICC Vaccination Centre of Hope for their COVID-19 jab.

Officials here said that more than 880 vaccine doses had already been administered within a few hours of opening on Friday morning. "It's actually for the greater good. I've got family who are high-risk," a young man explained. #COVID19SA Brynn Travill says he’s getting jabbed for the greater good of our country.

"I'm so excited and so pumped and I'm ready to write matric without mocks being interrupted," one of the matric pupils explained. The other said: "I'm really excited. It's a bit disappointing that the reason that I'm here is the lack of demand and that's why they're offering it to this age group now." More than 53,000 people in this age group in the Western Cape have already registered since Thursday night. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
