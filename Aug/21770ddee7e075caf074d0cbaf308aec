JOHANNESBURG - The Jacob Zuma Foundation on Friday said there would be no delay in the arms deal court case, which is expected to be heard next week, despite the former president being hospitalised for a medical observation in the morning. The Department of Correctional Services has confirmed that Zuma was granted permission to receive medical assistance at a facility outside the Estcourt Correctional Centre where he is serving his 15 months jail term. He was found guilty by the Constitutional Court after he refused to cooperate with the state capture commission of inquiry, which he set up during his tenure as predisent. Zuma's arms deal trial is set down for three days from Tuesday in the Pietermaritzburg High Court and he will be there in person.

He is about to unleash, he is about to ensure that he tells the truth as he knows it.” However, Zuma is still at an undisclosed hospital for a scheduled check-up and it’s not yet clear how long this will take. But Manyi is convinced it won't have any impact on his court case next week. “We’re all hopeful that after the medical check-up, there’ll be nothing untoward. But I can tell you know that President Zuma’s state of mind now is to be in court.” READ: He's fine: Foundation says Zuma's hospitalisation is a scheduled check-up Zuma is facing corruption charges along with French arms company Thales.
