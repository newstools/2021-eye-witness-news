JOHANNESBURG – Health Minister Joe Phaahla said that government was considering the possibility of making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory, but for now, no such decision had been made. Earlier this week, Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba said that she wanted to meet with the alcohol industry to discuss the possibility of only selling booze to people who've had their jab. So far, more than 11.6 million shots have been administered in this country, but the aim is to vaccinate 70% of the population by December.
