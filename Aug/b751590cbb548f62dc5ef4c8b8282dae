JOHANNESBURG – The Basic Education Department said that it was very worried about pupils losing out on the curriculum since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The department said that it was also likely that this loss of learning would have a greater impact in poorer communities where children had less access to effective remote opportunities and home support. Spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said that the first step towards addressing the crisis of lost learning was to prevent further disruptions to schools where pupils were already playing catch up with their workload.
