He said officers were under a lot of pressure. “As an organisation we are just stressed and people putting us under pressure for many things. Even the looters they put us under pressure. When they loot, they say ‘don’t take the things we looted’, and we hear even people shouting and saying: ‘please don’t take those things that are looted’.” #sapsGP Minister of Police, General Bheki Cele, DPC Policing, Lt Gen Masemola, Gauteng Acting Provincial Commissioner, Maj Gen Mthombeni and fellow mourners at the cemetery, paying their last respect to the late Constable Molefi. #FinalSalute ME pic.twitter.com/neA6K8ETG9  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
