CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) parliamentary caucus has welcomed the nomination of former Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula as the next National Assembly Speaker. Her nomination follows President Cyril Ramaphosa's Cabinet reshuffle where he replaced her with then Speaker Thandi Modise as defence minister. ANC acting caucus spokesperson Nomfanelo Kota said Mapisa-Nqakula would bring a wealth of experience to her new role. “Former Minister Mapisa-Nqakula brings a formidable work experience to the new position, with a solid track record as a legislature and policy maker spanning over a number of years. The caucus welcomes her nomination.” Until last week, Mapisa-Nqakula had served as a minister of defence and military veterans from June 2012. Previously, she was minister of home affairs from 2004 to 2009 and minister of correctional services from 2009 to 2012. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
