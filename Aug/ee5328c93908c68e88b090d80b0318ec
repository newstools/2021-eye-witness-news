JOHANNESBURG - People between the ages of 18 and 34 might be able to get their COVID-19 vaccines sooner than planned. As things stand, those in the 18 to 34 cohort have to wait until 1 September before they can get a jab. However, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said they were speaking to Cabinet in a bid to open up the COVID-19 vaccine sites for all adults as early as this week.
