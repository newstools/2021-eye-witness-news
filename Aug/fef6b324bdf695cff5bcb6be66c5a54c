"We are indeed happy that the Constitutional Court has issued the directive requiring all parties concerned in the recession application to submit 20 pages to talk to the issue of the continued detention of President Zuma. For us what this means is that the Constitutional Court is engaged in a process of reflection of the legal argument that the lawyers have put on the table" said The Foundation spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi. The Foundation maintains the jailing of the former president is illegal - claiming that he did not receive a fair trial and his health and wellbeing was not considered when he was sentenced to 15 months behind bars at the Estcourt correctional services facility in KwaZulu-Natal.
