JOHANNESBURG - There's a sigh of relief on Thursday from Mango employees with a commitment that last month's full salaries will be paid. However, many are still sceptical, saying they would believe it only when the money reflected in their bank accounts. The cash-strapped airline has not been able to pay salaries since May. READ: Mango to pay out full salaries for July, August & September to its staff But during a creditors meeting with the business rescue practitioner on Wednesday, the assurance was given that July salaries will be paid "imminently". They also promised to pay full salaries for August and September, depending on the money being released by the Department of Public Enterprises and the South African Airways. The exact dates of when the money will be released still need to be communicated to staff with some confirming to Eyewitness News that there is still nothing in their bank account.

I’m not sure as yet what the future holds for me.” It’s not yet clear when Mango planes will take off again. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
