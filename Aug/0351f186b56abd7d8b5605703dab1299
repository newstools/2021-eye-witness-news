CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC)  said it is approaching the Electoral Court to reopen the IEC’s candidate nominations process ahead of the local government elections. The IEC closed its system on Monday night after opening it to parties on 3 August.

The ANC said it faced challenges “beyond its control” when it uploaded its candidates’ list on Monday.
