JOHANNESBURG - Daily COVID-19 infection numbers remain steady and show no indication of decreasing rapidly. So far 238 more people had died in South Africa in the last 24-hour period, bringing the death toll to 76,869. New infections remained in the double digits for the past few days at 13,021 new cases in the last cycle. This brings the total number of confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak to 2,595,447. SLOWING VACCINATION RATEThe Health Department said on Sunday that only 49,000 COVID-19 vaccines had been administered nationwide in the past 24 hours. The icy temperatures that have gripped most parts of the country could have discouraged some residents from going out to get their jabs this weekend following reports of a low turnout at vaccination sites.

The lowest turnout, though, was in the Northern Cape with 262. The Department said it would intensify its drive to encourage those who were eligible to join the vaccination line and bemoaned the number of men refusing to part take in the mass inoculation drive.
