DURBAN – The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has said May 2022 would be the ideal time to hold the local government elections. The party's President Velenkosini Hlabisa has toldEyewitness News that government still needs to ensure a mass vaccination programme to minimise the risk of infections to allow for fair campaigning. Hlabisa said although his party accepted the recommendation by Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke to postpone the elections to February next year, he believes it is a busy month as it follows the festive season.
