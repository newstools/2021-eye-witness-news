Depositors and investors lost their money including municipalities, which had transferred funds to be kept by VBS. The case of 14 suspects was delayed due to a change of legal representatives by some of the accused. The judge has ordered a pretrial conference to allow for consultation, and for the prosecution to iron other the issues. The suspects have denied the charges, with others claiming that they were not given the opportunity to respond to the findings of the report by Advocate Jerry Motau. He listed details of looting, implicating a number of people in 2018. The bank was placed under curatorship by the Reserve Bank, and a forensic investigation was instituted to establish exactly what went wrong and it's expected that more details will be disclosed when the trial begins in over two months’ time.
