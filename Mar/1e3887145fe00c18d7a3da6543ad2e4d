He was shot and killed in Clayville East on Thursday during an apparent case of mistaken identity. Relatives say the 22-year-old was shot in the back after police mistook him for a hijacker. The family is now calling for justice. #MusaMagasela The family of a slain Tembisa soccer coach say they want justice - after he was shot by police - during an apparent case of mistaken identity. #justiceformusamagasela has been trending on social media following the incident on Thursday.

Makwela said he wanted answers as police officials had supplied the family with conflicting reports. “At the moment I’m trying to gather all the information into what happened, but the police are not able to give me a straight answer.” He’s heading to Ipid's offices in Pretoria on Monday morning to follow up on the investigation: “There’s no way that Musa could’ve been able to hijack, but like I’m saying, I was not there but I’m crying now...I’m crying for justice.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
