JOHANNESBURG – Church leaders have said they are optimistic about President Cyril Ramaphosa's response to their request of keeping churches open over the Easter period. This follows a meeting between religious leaders representing all denominations and churches in the country with Ramaphosa, where they requested that places of worship be reopened to a minimum of 50% capacity – with strict safety protocols. Last year, not long after the country imposed level 5 lockdown regulations, Easter gatherings were banned. With concerns around a spike in COVID-19 infections over the upcoming religious holidays, the president is expected to make an announcement soon on what measures will be implemented to curb a further spread.
