JOHANNESBURG - Former operational manager at the Fourways Cemetery Deon Klingbiel has told the court that he didn't see the altercation between a police officer, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)’s Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi even though cameras are installed on-site. The two are back in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday morning for their assault trial. Klingbiel is the first witness on the stand testifying in the trial. He said he was made aware of the incident only when a police officer approached him later in the day to get evidence. “Later that afternoon an officer came to me to inform me about the incident.” Klingbiel said he saved the video surveillance of an altercation between a police officer and EFF leaders to a hard drive and then deleted it only after police had made copies. He said he deleted the footage because it contained sensitive information. The pair are accused of assaulting police officer Jacobus Venter at the Fourways Memorial Cemetery in 2018 at struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral. During their last court appearance in October, Venter said Malema became hostile when he was asked to present the necessary permit to enter the burial site. On Tuesday, the court expects to hear testimony from the operational manager of the cemetery. The first investigative officer and other high-ranking police officials will also give testimony on Tuesday.
