WASHINGTON - Google will invest more than $7 billion in the United States this year and create thousands of jobs, the tech giant's CEO said Thursday. "We plan to invest over $7 billion in offices and data centers across the US and create at least 10,000 new full-time Google jobs in the US this year," Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Pichai said Google "wants to be a part" of America's economic recovery from the pandemic and is investing in some communities that are new to the company, as well as expanding in others across 19 states. The announcement comes as Google faces pressure from dozens of US states that accuse the internet giant of abusing its search dominance to eliminate competition. Google will spend $1 billion in its home state of California. Outside of the San Fransisco Bay Area, Google said it would add thousands of jobs in Atlanta, Washington DC, Chicago and New York. "This will help bring more jobs and investment to diverse communities as part of our previously announced racial equity commitments," Pichai said. Google's parent company Alphabet last month reported a 50% jump in quarterly profit to $15.2 billion as its digital ad business thrived.
