Nongoma Local Municipality Mayor Albert Mncwango said they did not want King Zwelithini's send-off to be a super-spreader event. “We made sure that everyone who walks into the palace actually gets assessed for COVID-19, we sanitise them, take temperatures and we keep record where possible.” A law enforcement led motorcade with some members of the Zulu Royal Family has just arrived at the Kwakhethomthandayo Royal Palace at Nongoma, northern KZN. The family is expected to discuss the funeral arrangements of the late #KingZwelithini. @NkoRaphael pic.twitter.com/3knwLbB6kZ  Obituary: Longest reigning king of AmaZulu, #KingZwelithini - a "fountain of wisdom"https://t.co/gSsd04GSaF  A memorial service has been scheduled on behalf of the late monarch on Thursday.
