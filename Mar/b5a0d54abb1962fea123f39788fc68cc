JOHANNESBURG - The state capture commission continues to hear Transnet-related evidence from the former CEO Brian Molefe on Tuesday. On Monday, he told the commission that the first he knew that he was being considered for the Transnet CEO position was when a recruitment agency called him to submit his CV. He said that he was capable but not a corruption detection machine. “I was definitely not a corruption detection machine. That does not mean that if I saw the corruption that I could not understand it or was incapable of understanding it. I’m just saying I’m not a specialist corruption detection machine."
