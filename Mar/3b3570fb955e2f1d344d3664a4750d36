I see much more frustration about the access rather than then hesitancy to take the vaccine." It's been a month since the Johnson & Johnson vaccine first arrived and so far around 147,000 healthcare workers have been inoculated. A total of 500,000 are expected to be vaccinated by the end of next month. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
