JOHANNESBURG – Eskom said due to further loss of generation capacity, Stage 2 load shedding will continue until 5 am on Wednesday. The power utility implemented the scheduled blackouts on Wednesday last week, after heavy losses to its generating capacity. While load shedding was set to end on Friday, it was extended into the weekend following more disruptions as Eskom battled to restore more than 18,000 megawatts to the grid.

However, spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said there have been more breakdowns. In its statement on Sunday, the power utility said it was working hard to return the broken down back to service, and has requested the public to continue to use power sparingly. "“During the week, we have suffered further breakdowns at five power stations, putting further strain on the generation systems. Additional breakdowns occurred at Tutuka, Majuba, Kusile, Matimba and Duvha power stations; adding to breakdowns at the Kriel and Kendall power stations.” #PowerAlert1Stage 2 loadshedding will be extended to 05:00 on Wednesday following the loss of furthergeneration capacity and to replenish emergency generation reserves@News24 @SABCNews @NewzroomAfrika @eNCA @IOL @ewnupdates @SundayTimesZA @SowetanLIVE pic.twitter.com/P9xezDoIBG  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
