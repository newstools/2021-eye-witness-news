READ: SA's Q4 economic growth was largely due to easing of lockdown restrictions Stats SA said the annual real GDP growth rate decline was primarily led by decreases in manufacturing, trade, catering, and accommodation, among others.   These are the same industries where GDP increased in the fourth quarter. "A negative 7% growth of the year 2020 has seen all industries growing in the negative except government and perhaps agriculture," said Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke. Meanwhile, agriculture, forestry and fishing increased by 13.1% last year. Despite the annualized GDP increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, the year-on-year decline was recorded at 4.1%.
