Cooperative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile has released the findings of an inquiry. Gauteng municipalities owed Rand Water and Eskom significant amounts of money and the report has called for a long-term solution to create funded budgets and management of its creditor’s books. However, it said that the capacity to manage intergovernmental debt needed the support of the provincial government.
