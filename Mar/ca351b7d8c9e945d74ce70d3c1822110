JOHANNESBURG - Auditor General Tsakani Maluleke  on Wednesday said Gauteng paid R501 million in claims for medical negligence in 2019/20 even though only R2.6 million was budgeted for. She has released the outcome of her department’s audits, which show that all provinces have been unable to budget for these claims. Maluleke said in all provinces, health and education were the two departments that couldn't budget properly and ended up overspending.
