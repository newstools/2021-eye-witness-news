JOHANNESBURG – Minerals and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said the procurement of 2,600 megawatts under the latest bid round for private power producers would go to the market at midnight on Thursday. He announced on Thursday, the first eight successful bidders to provide emergency electricity and help prop up the country's ailing power supply. The tender for 2,000 megawatts was launched two years ago when the country suffered some of the worst power cuts in a decade.
