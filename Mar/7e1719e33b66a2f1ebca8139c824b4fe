CAPE TOWN - With the possibility of another so-called 'family meeting' ahead of the Easter break, the liquor industry is anxious another liquor ban will be imposed. Role players in the hard-hit sector are waiting to see whether President Cyril Ramaphosa could announce stricter lockdown regulations for the Easter long weekend. The industry has lost in excess of R36.3 billion in revenue due to various alcohol bans over the last year.
