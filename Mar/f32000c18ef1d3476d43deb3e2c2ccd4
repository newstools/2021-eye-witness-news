DURBAN - The first democratically elected mayor of eThekwini is expected to be laid to rest on Thursday. Sipho Ngwenya passed away last Sunday. He served as mayor of eThekwini from 1994 to 1996 and later became chairperson of the KwaZulu-Natal Local Government Association.

Current Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has described Ngwenya as a visionary who laid a solid foundation for eThekwini in post-apartheid South Africa. His son, Nathi, has described Ngwenya as a gentle family man. “Obviously to the community, he was a community man. He was a loving father to us all his children and grandchildren. We love him dearly.” At the time of his passing, Ngwenya was Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s representative in the eThekwini region. He was 79 years old.
