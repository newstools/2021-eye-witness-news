DURBAN – The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) is expected to pay former President Jacob Zuma a visit on Friday. The league’s president Bathabile Dlamini is expected to lead a delegation that will include Kwazulu-Natal chairperson Nonhlanhla Khoza and provincial secretary Nonhlanhla Gabela. In a statement, the league said the purpose of the visit was to consolidate unity within the party. The ANCWL said it wanted to use its visit to Nkandla to close gaps between the African National Congress (ANC) and its former leaders.
