JOHANNESBURG - Former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe said that it was an oversight on his part that ministerial approval was not obtained for increasing the price of the 1,064 locomotives because he was human. Molefe was continuing with his testimony at the state capture commission on the acquisition of the locomotives. The former CEO maintained that the initial price of the locomotives included hedging and escalation but when bids were submitted, the market showed Transnet the real price.
