CAPE TOWN – The City of Cape Town has called for the arrest of those who allegedly petrol-bombed, looted, and demolished structures at a Masiphumelele temporary housing project. The project was launched after thousands of residents lost their homes during a devastating fire in December. READ: More than 400 emergency structures put up in Masiphumelele after December fire About 350 temporary structures were torched on Friday night, allegedly by protesters who are against the development. The project which aimed to provide homes for fire-affected victims has been marred by protests in recent weeks. Community leaders said young people were adamant that they do not want to sacrifice the sports field on which some of these homes were being built. They said children rely on the field as their only means of entertainment. The City's Ward 69 councillor Felicity Purchase however believes there is more to this, and that the acts of criminality were politically motivated.
