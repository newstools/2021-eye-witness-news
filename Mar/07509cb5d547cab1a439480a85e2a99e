CAPE TOWN – A group of protesting University of Cape Town (UCT) students has occupied the campus' Kramer building on Friday. They are demanding that Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng and university management address their financial struggles face to face. They also want around 2,500 financially excluded students be allowed to register. The building houses the campus' student financial aid office. This follows days of protests in Johannesburg by Wits University students making similar demands – including the scrapping of historical debt. #UCTProtest The group of UCT students are marching up Main Road, towards the campus Kramer Building.

Some of them have graduated but they are unable to receive their transcripts, and they are unemployable because they don’t have something that says that these people have graduated, and these are their marks.” READ: Nzimande has until 5 pm to respond to students or face shutdown Students Representative Council (SRC) president Declan Dyer said: “This is the headquarters of the fees office, this is the headquarters of financial aid, and the headquarters of student housing is there. This is now the student centre. We will occupy Kramer. The SRC offices will now be based at Kramer.” The university said it has more than 1,600 students with historic debt, amounting to R88 million. UCT said over the past few years, it had put measures in place to assist eligible students with historic debt – with around R30 million set aside this year.
