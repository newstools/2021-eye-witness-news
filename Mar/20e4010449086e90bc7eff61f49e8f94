CAPE TOWN - A year after the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) released a report into the forced sterilisation of women living with HIV, rights organisations said that there had been little action from government. In February last year, the commission found that complainants were not provided with adequate knowledge on the sterilisation procedure before being asked to consent. A report stated that this violated their right to information.

"This includes persistent pressure from doctors and other healthworkers that they must sterilise due to their HIV status. If the women said 'no, I do not want to be sterilised', this was overlooked." Mthembu said that despite the organisation and the Positive Women's Network's consistent attempts to seek justice for forced sterilisation victims, there had been little action from government. "We have conducted research, lobbied but none of that has led to any action from the government to bring possibly sterilised women justice." The organisations said that justice delayed was justice denied. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
