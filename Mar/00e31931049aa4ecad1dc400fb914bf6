JOHANNESBURG – The Independent Policing Union of South Africa (Ipusa) has welcomed the decision to grant the four police officers accused of killing Mthokozisi Ntumba bail. Tshepiso Kekana, Motseothata Boitumelo, Madimeja Legodi and Victor Nkosinathi Mohammed were granted R8,000 bail by the Johannesburg Magistrates court on Friday. In handing down judgment, Magistrate Sipho Sibanyoni said that it would not be in the interest of justice to deny them bail, as they aren’t flight risks and he believed they won’t evade trial.
