DURBAN - Supporters of former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede, said that the case against her was part of a smear campaign against the African National Congress (ANC). Gumede and 21 others face fraud, corruption and money laundering charges linked to a 2017 multi-million rand waste collection tender. In an indictment, the State has alleged that Gumede’s improper interference into the appointment of service providers in eThekwini also benefited the governing party, its councillors and structures such as the MKMVA.

"If you look at the nature of the charges and the nature of this whole process and how it's been conducted, it tells you that it's politically motivated and if it's politically motivated it automatically translates to the ANC being put on trial. Now whether that is being done by people who are within us [the party] or outside us, it has a bearing on how the ANC will come out of this process." Gumede and her co-accused are expected to appear in the Durban High Court for a pre-trial conference on 14 June. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
