"Many monarchs are no longer respected, many monarchs are not taken seriously because of simple issues of unity." He said that King Zwelithini’s successor should be brave enough to enter the debate on the Ingonyama Trust, which controls about 2.8 million hectares of land in KwaZulu-Natal. "It's a necessary debate, we should not be a nation that is scared of debating controversial issues, including issues we don't all agree on. The discussion are not necessitated by the desire to kill. We engage because we must find each other." The late monarch is expected to be planted on Thursday. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
