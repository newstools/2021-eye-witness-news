READ: 4 police officers accused of murdering Mthokozisi Ntumba granted bail The four police officers accused of killing Mthokozisi Ntumba were released for now but with strict bail conditions. Reacting to the judgment, Sapu’s Dorothy Sithole said that while they were against acts of police brutality, the accused were merely executing their duties. "It’s either we die or we end up in jail, it's between the two now because police officers are also human beings. They’ve got families, as you can see there, it’s their families that are so much affected."

We act, we in the wrong. We don’t act, we are in the wrong. In this protest, if it was a peaceful protest, we wouldn’t be where we are. If it was a peaceful protest, everybody was supposed to go home free."
