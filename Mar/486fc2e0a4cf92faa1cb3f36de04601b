JOHANNESBURG - Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande on Monday said those responsible for accepting extra first-year students at the University of South Africa (Unisa) for two consecutive years must be called to account. The portfolio committee on higher education has summoned the university to explain why it failed to stick to its enrollment plans. Unisa's student representatives are taking Nzimande to court, accusing him of instructing Unisa to cut down the number of new students by 20,000 this year.
