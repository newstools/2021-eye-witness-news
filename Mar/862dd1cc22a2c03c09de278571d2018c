Talking about the king, Dr Gugu Mazibuko had this to say: "Zulus don't die, you move from one state into the other." Zulu royal historian and author, Shola Dlamini, explained what would happen tonight when King Goodwill Zwelethini is interred according to custom. “Remember when the king gets buried, he doesn’t lie down. He's put in a sitting position because he is the king, a tree that is planted there to show that he is going to live forever,” she said.
