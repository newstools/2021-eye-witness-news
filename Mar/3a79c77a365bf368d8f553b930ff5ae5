CAPE TOWN - South African Airways (SAA) had received and used most of the 10.5-billion-rand bailout it received last year. The funds were earmarked for the airline’s restructuring while it underwent a business rescue process. The SAA business rescue practitioners on Thursday briefed Parliament’s finance watchdog, Scopa.

To date, chair and honourable members, SAA has received R7.8 billion for the implementation of the business rescue plan." Dongwana said that the airline’s workforce had been reduced from 4,700 to 1,000 employees through voluntary severance packages and the Section 189 restructuring process.
