He said at some point, he was unfairly accused of nepotism. “Some would say the leader has influence on certain panels, in terms of certain candidates, and even went as far as saying there is a need to change the constitution just to stops provincial leaders from participating in panels – the truth you all to know today. I have never manipulated any process.” Mncwango has called on those contesting leadership positions to ensure they remain ethical at all times. KZN member of the provincial legislature Francois Rodgers, eThekwini caucus leader Nicole Graham and her deputy Emmanuel Mhlongo are in the running for the position of DA provincial leader.
