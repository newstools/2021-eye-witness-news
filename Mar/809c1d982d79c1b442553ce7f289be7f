CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Community Safety Department has condemned protests that have affected the N2 highway and several other major routes. Sections of the N2 highway, Mew Way, Baden Powell Drive, the R300 and Hindle Road have been affected since the early hours of Tuesday morning. The protests hit various communities including Khayelitsha, Langa, Philippi, Nyanga, Mfuleni and Kraaifontein. Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz indicated that the demonstrations were over housing and basic service delivery. “While everyone has the constitutional right to protest, resorting to violence and destruction is simply unacceptable. It is dangerous and illegal to do so at the expense of the rights of others. Especially their right to safety, to property and to move freely,” said the MES’s spokesperson Cayla Murray. #KraaifonteinProtest Situation remains tense in Kraaifontein as hundreds of protesters took to the streets.
