JOHANNESBURG - Two Wits University students are appearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court for a formal bail application on Friday. They were arrested last week during protests in Braamfontein. They were remanded in custody earlier this week after it emerged they have pending cases in Stellenbosch. The pair is facing a charge of public violence. A small group of Wits University students are demonstrating outside the magistrates court calling for their release. Wits student representative council president Mpendulo Mfeka said: “It was agreed that during the preliminary stages that we can't afford to have them in prison… so that is why we are [demonstrating] outside the Johannesburg Magistrates Court.” TIMELINE: University students demand an end to financial exclusion  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
