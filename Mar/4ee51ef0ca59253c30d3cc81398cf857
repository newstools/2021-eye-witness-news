CAPE TOWN – An Eastern Cape court has sentenced a teenage boy to an effective 13 years behind bars for raping two children in Booysen Park. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on Friday said the convicted rapist was 17-years-old, and he was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Regional Court this week on two counts of rape. The NPA said in September 2019, when he was 16 years old, he raped a nine-year-old boy and was released into the care of his parents. However, he then sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl in June last year. He was apprehended and remained behind bars. The NPA's Anelisa Ngcakani said both victims were known to him. “Five years of the 10-year sentence for the rape of the boy was suspended, and two years of the 10-year sentence for the rape of the girl was suspended –  meaning that the boy will serve 13 years direct imprisonment.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
