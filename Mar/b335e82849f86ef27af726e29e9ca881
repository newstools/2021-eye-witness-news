JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that it believed that it had a strong case against the four police officers accused of the murder of Mthokozisi Ntumba. Ntumba was shot and killed last week when police fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of protesting students in Braamfontein. The men, aged between 27 and 51, made their first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on Wednesday.
