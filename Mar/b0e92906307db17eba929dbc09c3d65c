CAPE TOWN - A small group of students has been picketing in front of the Cape Town central police station on Thursday. They have gathered to show solidarity with fellow students at Wits University, which is at the centre of protests against historical student debt - among other issues. The protesters, who all wore black, said Thursday was a sad day for students. They silently held up their placards, some of which read 'Justice for Mthokozisi', 'Fees must fall' and 'All students to register.'
