Head of Health Dr Keith Cloete says it's anticipated that they will be able to cover 40% of health care workers with the limited doses being received via the Sisonke Programme. He said thus far the process has been slow and tight. The department is preparing to rapidly scale up vaccination to multiple sites during April to complete Phase 1 depending on vaccine availability. Cloete said they were expecting the Pfizer vaccine to arrive. "With the arrival of the Pfizer vaccine, we will scale up the rate and how many vaccines we do per day." At the time of this report, there were 24 active cases among health workers, 11 nurses, three doctors and other categories of staff. "In the last couple of weeks, we only seeing cases one to two to three cases per week. While it might be early days, but it might be the early signs of really starting to see an impact of the vaccinations among healthcare workers."
