JOHANNESBURG – The South African Policing Union (Sapu) has said it wants the officials who gave the orders to disperse protesting students on the day that Mthokozisi Ntumba died to also have their day in court. Cidrass Motseothata, Madimetsa Legodi, Victor Mohammed, and Tshepiso Kekana have been charged in connection with Ntumba’s death. He was killed during a student protest over financial exclusion earlier this month in Braamfontein. The officers were each granted bail of R8,000 by the Johannesburg Magistrates Court on Friday. Comply now and complain later – this is how Sapu’s Dorothy Sithole has described law enforcement’s response to violent protests.

So, in situations like this, you get an instruction from your senior and as a police officer you need to comply and complain later. So, complying landed us in hot water.” Sithole says while more can be done to guide officers on how to handle crowd control - the four accused are not guilty of the crimes they have been charged with.
