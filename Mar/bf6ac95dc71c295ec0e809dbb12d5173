JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the events at Wits University were deeply disturbing and that the country was mourning the death of Mthokozisi Ntumba. The 35-year-old father of four was shot during a protest by Wits University students in Braamfontein on Wednesday. The president was addressing the National House of Traditional Leaders: "Mthokozisi Ntumba was an innocent bystander and indeed even, I would say, the students, much as they were protesting, the way I saw it on televisions did not warrant the type of resistance and push from our police." The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating the circumstances of the killing and visited Ntumba's home on Thursday morning, along with Police Minister Bheki Cele.
