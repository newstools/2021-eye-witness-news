UCT spokesperson, Elijah Moholola, said that the university had set aside around R30 million to assist eligible students with historic debt this year. "The pending NSFSA outcomes do not necessarily prohibit students from registering for the 2021 academic year. UCT does not charge any registration fees. Students can register without having to make any payment, including the minimum initial payment." UCT said that only students who met specified eligibility requirements could be considered for funding. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
