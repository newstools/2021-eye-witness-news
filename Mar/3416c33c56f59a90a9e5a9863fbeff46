JOHANNESBURG - The South African Medical Association (Sama) has lost its last legal bid to overturn a ruling that ordered it to return millions of rands’ worth of assets to trade union Samatu. The Constitutional Court has dismissed the association’s leave to appeal a Labour Court ruling which ordered it to transfer money to the trade union.

Sama was disputing a ruling made in May last year which found that it had unduly taken advantage of the trade union structure to benefit financially from it.

The payments will be backdated to cover the past 20 years. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
