However, the foundation said that the probe had shown a number of financial and human resources policies and procedures needed to be revised, strengthened and restated to ensure consistency and compliance. The investigation was initiated after an email was sent to the chairperson of the board by an anonymous staff member in December. The appointed law firm tasked with looking into the claims conducted interviews with 21 staff members during January and February. They clustered the complaints into four areas of investigation - the culture at the foundation, procurement, improper use of resources and the abuse of donor relations. The final report was presented to the board of trustees this week and it was accepted unanimously. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
