JOHANNESBURG - The South African Police Union (Sapu) said that while officers were against police brutality, officers felt let down with no clear recommendations on how to act against violent protesters. There are growing calls for government to review the use of rubber bullets, with the police's conduct once again in sharp focus. Mthokozisi Ntumba was killed in Braamfontein earlier this month when police fired rubber bullets at a group of protesting students.

"There is a recommendation from a panel of experts that is before the minister that talks about the bill that must be approved at Parliament on policing during this kind of protest. That recommendation has not been implemented. It's been more than two years now." Meanwhile, independent researcher specialising in policing and public security, David Bruce, said that there was no need to ban the use of rubber bullets, officers simply needed to get clear guidelines. "I think it would not be good for policing to eliminate them entirely. The manner in which the police are using them right at the moment is completely counter-productive." Bruce also sat on the panel of experts appointed by the Marikana commission of inquiry to look into all the policing problems highlighted by the 2012 massacre. He believed that government was failing in its duty to properly regulate the manner in which officers used rubber bullets. WATCH: Police brutality in South Africa: Are rubber bullets necessary?
