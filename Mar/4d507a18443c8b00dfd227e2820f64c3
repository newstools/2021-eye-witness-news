DURBAN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal has on Wednesday called on the African National Congress (ANC) to remove former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede from the KwaZulu-Natal legislature with immediate effect. This follows a recent ANC NEC  decision that all members facing corruption and other serious charges must step aside from roles linked to the party within 30 days.

Gumede and 21 others face over 2,000 counts of fraud, corruption and money laundering linked to an eThekwini municipality tender amounting to R320 million.

This is to protect the integrity of the institution and ensure that the institution is above reproach.” ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela said Gumede was previously cleared by the party’s provincial integrity commission due to delays and multiple postponements in the case against her. Ntombela said they were now looking at how best to implement the NEC decision in consultation with national office bearers. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
