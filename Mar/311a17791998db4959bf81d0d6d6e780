Mabuza has allayed fears, saying that the vaccine space was highly-regulated. "The acquisition of the COVID-19 vaccine, there is limited room for such corruption as the market is highly-regulated, with few manufacturers." On Health Minister Mkhize having close associates linked with a dodgy Health Department tender, Mabuza said that the matter would be dealt with once investigations had been completed. "And the Special Investigating Unit is following that and we leave it at that up until this unit comes out with a finding, then we'll take it up from there. That was the response that was given by the president." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
