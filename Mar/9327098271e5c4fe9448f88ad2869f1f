CAPE TOWN – The University of Cape Town (UCT) has said that all returning students with 2020 historical debt would be allowed to register for the 2021 academic year. The move follows protests that erupted at Wits University last week and spread to campuses around the country, as students took a stand against financial exclusion.

The decision however does not scrap historical debt, as the institution's current intake of students has student debt amounting to R88 million. “The funding crisis is indeed a national crisis, no university can solve it on its own. The higher education sector urgently needs intervention by the government.” The university reiterated that R30 million had been set aside to support eligible students in the process of servicing their debt.
