JOHANNESBURG - Wits University student leaders on Tuesday visited the family of Mthokozisi Ntumba, who was killed during last week's protests. The students had asked for permission from the family to allow them to make a proposal to the university to rename the institution’s hardship fund in his honour. The fund was set up to help students who need financial assistance with registration and accommodation. Four police officers were arrested yesterday in connection with Ntumba’s shooting and are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate Court on Wednesday.
