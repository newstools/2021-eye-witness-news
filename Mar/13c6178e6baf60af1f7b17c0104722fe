A drive-by shooting is even worse than someone standing in front of you and shooting you because in a drive-by the bullets are flying all over the show. And unfortunately, this child was caught in the crossfire," said the Steenberg community policing forum's Gavin Walbragh. That same day, a 6-year-old girl was caught in a gang crossfire in Wesbank and she was wounded. A man was shot dead in that attack. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
