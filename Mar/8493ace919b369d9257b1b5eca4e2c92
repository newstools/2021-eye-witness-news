JOHANNESBURG - Eskom said that it had no choice but to continue with rolling blackouts because it could not compromise the maintenance of its aging fleet of power stations. The power utility presented the state of its system at a briefing from Megawatt Park on Monday afternoon. It said that planned maintenance was satisfactory between 2010 and 2014 but poor between 2018 and 2020. READ: Worst-case scenario of 26 days of stage 2 power cuts this winter, says Eskom Eskom executives said that they agreed that the ongoing power cuts were unacceptable but they did not want to plunge the power utility back to where it was at the height of load shedding. COO Jan Oberholzer said that there was always a risk of 50% unplanned outages and only maintenance could prevent that.

Oberholzer said that it was important to ensure the reliability of the old fleet and to improve the performance of new stations. He said that that would reduce uncertainty.
