READ: Parly to decide on inquiry into Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office The ANC in Parliament will hold an emergency meeting at 1 pm. Eyewitness News understands this is to receive a line of march from the party’s Luthuli House headquarters over whether to move for and against an inquiry into Mkhwebane. Over the weekend, ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina said the caucus would support an inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Some of the ANC’s MP including MKMVA president Kebby Maphatsoe had rejected this, arguing no such decision had been reached during Thursday’s meeting. Maphatsoe has described a statement by Majodina as having complicated and compromised a simple matter. He said the ANC had no business voting with what he called the enemy. “We can’t work with organisations that we ideologically differ from, so we don’t have any ideological relationship with the DA.” Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court has dismissed the Public Protector’s application for direct access to appeal the Western Cape High Court's ruling that refused her interdict to stop the parliamentary inquiry into her fitness to hold office The apex court said Mkhwebane didn’t make a case for direct access to the court.
