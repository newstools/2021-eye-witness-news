JOHANNESBURG – The people spoke and the president obliged! President Cyril Ramaphosa was initially scheduled to host a family meeting on Tuesday at 7 pm as experts expressed fears about a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ahead of the Easter holiday. The problem is, veteran isiXhosa newsreader Noxolo Grootboom is set to retire after 37 years in the industry. Her last bulletin is on Tuesday night, also at 7 pm. The Presidency then announced that Ramaphosa would now address the nation at 7.30 pm to allow people to witness their favourite broadcaster for the last time. President @CyrilRamaphosa will address the nation at 19h30 today, to allow SABC viewers to watch veteran newsreader #NoxoloGrootbooms final bulletin as she retires after 37 years.  https://t.co/oH8AY5Yznx  The much-loved broadcaster will beam across the nation for the last time after 37 years of gracing Mzansi's homes on most nights.
