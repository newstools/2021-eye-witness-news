JOHANNESBURG — Sports, Arts, and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa on Monday said the alleged mismanagement of COVID-19 relief funds for artists would be investigated. The National Arts Council initially approved more than 1,300 beneficiaries, but so far just over 500 have been paid from the Presidential Employment Stimulus Programme. Mthethwa stresses that money has not gone missing and that the National Arts Council has simply overcommitted funds to be disbursed. “R300 billion is still there, part of it has been disbursed already and part of it is being disbursed. The is nothing like money that disappeared, no money disappeared".
