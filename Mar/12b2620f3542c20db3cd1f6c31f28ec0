CAPE TOWN - The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the repo unchanged at 3.5%. South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago announced that the interest rates will remain as they are, which means the nation's prime lending rate stays at 7%. "Inflation is expected to be well-contained in 2021 before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target range for 2022 and 2023. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. The decision was unanimous." The decision is in line with market expectations.
