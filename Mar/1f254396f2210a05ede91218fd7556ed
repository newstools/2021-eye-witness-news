JOHANNESBURG - Eskom on Wednesday said that another unit had come online at its Kusile power station. The utility said that this brought to three the number of units that had achieved commercial operation status at the project. This latest development should add thousands of megawatts to the grid at a time when Eskom has been battling to supply reliable electricity in South Africa. #EskomMediaStatement Kusile Unit 3 achieves commercial operation, bringing half the project to completion@IOL @News24 @SABCNews @eNCA @ewnreporter @Newzroom405 @TimesLIVE @SowetanLIVE @GovernmentZA pic.twitter.com/T7ICUWQZcC  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
