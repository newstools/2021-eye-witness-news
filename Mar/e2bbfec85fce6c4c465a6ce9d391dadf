JOHANNESBURG - Despite the country's universities committing to using debt relief mechanisms to assist academically deserving students to register, students at some campuses said that they would be continuing with their protests next week. Protesting students are calling for free higher education. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande met with management at universities this week to discuss, among other issues, funding and debt challenges. There appears to be no end in sight to student protests at some universities over the funding crisis facing the country's institutions of higher learning, an issue that crops up every year.
