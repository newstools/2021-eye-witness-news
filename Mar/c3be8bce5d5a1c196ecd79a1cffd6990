CAPE TOWN - Traffic Authorities in the Western Cape are gearing up for a busy long weekend. Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela on Wednesday launched the Easter traffic safety plan in Brackenfell. It's aimed at preventing crashes and infringements and will be implemented again over the Freedom Day and  Worker's Day long weekends. Madikizela said that they were continuously looking at ways to revise current methods and approaches to road safety. He said they would be focusing on offenders who repeatedly broke the law. As part of the first phase, he said that they had been able to upload records of habitual offenders where vehicles that had 10 or more infringements recorded over the last six months would appear. Traffic officers would be alerted whenever these offenders were sighted via handheld devices. Madikizela said that the tool would help to promote education and awareness, while tactfully equipping officers to enforce effectively. We're at the Easter Road Safety Launch this morning.
