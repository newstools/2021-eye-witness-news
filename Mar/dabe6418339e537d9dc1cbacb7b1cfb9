JOHANNESBURG - Former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama is on Thursday accusing the state capture commission of ambushing him by allowing witnesses to testify about him before he is notified. He said he had suffered prejudice at the hands of the commission, but things appeared to be improving. Gama said sometimes he would hear on television that he was being implicated when he wasn’t served with notices warning him ahead of time. Gama said he always received replies that say his letters had been received and the legal team would address his concerns. “The commission has been aware at all relevant times that I take the allegations against me seriously and do not appreciate being ambushed by the tactics that have been quite evidently employed by the evidence leaders.” WATCH LIVE: Commission continues to hear Transnet related evidence: Siyabonga Gama  VINDICTIVE Gama said Bowman Gilfillan director Christopher Todd’s allegations that he was handpicked by Malusi Gigaba to advance state capture and that he didn’t qualify were vindictive. He claims not only was he qualified but under his stewardship, Spoornet and subsequently Transnet Freight Rail thrived and became a key contributor of profits to the Transnet Group. Earlier this week, Gama agreed to postpone his application to cross-examine Todd, but he said he was happy to finally clear his name. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has apologised for lapses and delays in communication by the legal team. And he's appealed to Gama to use this opportunity answer questions giving his side of the story. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
