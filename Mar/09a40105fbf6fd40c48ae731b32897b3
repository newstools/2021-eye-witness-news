JOHANNESBURG - As four police officers prepare to make their first court appearance in connection with Mthokozisi Ntumba’s death on Wednesday, his family said they would not be satisfied until justice prevailed. Ntumba was shot and killed in Braamfontein last week when police fired rubber bullets at protesting students. The officers from the Public Order Policing Unit were apprehended on Monday.
