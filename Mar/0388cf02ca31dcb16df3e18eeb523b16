Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshanthsa: "During this period we have lost generation capacity at Medupi, Arnot and Komati power stations. Additionally, the return to service of four other units from the planned maintenance has been delayed, prolonging the need to continue implementing load shedding." #POWERALERT1Loadshedding will be reduced to Stage 1 from 05:00 on Wednesday and continue until 05:00 on Saturday as the power system is still severely constrained pic.twitter.com/V0LSjqKHDd  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
