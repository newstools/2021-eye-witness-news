CAPE TOWN — An Eastern Cape school principal has been charged with attempted murder after he apparently coerced an 11-year-old pupil to get into a pit toilet to retrieve his cellphone. Police said the 49-year-old made the learner undress and then tied him to a rope. The boy was lowered into the pit latrine by other learners. The incident took place at the Lututu Junior Secondary School in the Joe Gqabi district this month. "It’s a terrible incident and the MEC has instructed the head of the department to suspend the principal and to send a team of investigators," said the Eastern Cape Education Department's Vuyiseka Mboxela. The 49-year-old was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
