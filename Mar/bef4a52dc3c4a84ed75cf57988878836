JOHANNESBURG - The state capture commission has asked Brian Molefe if he had anything to do with the rise of Regiments, which went from being a subcontractor of McKinsey to becoming the main contractor. The former Transnet and Eskom CEO on Monday said he decided that Regiments should replace the Letsema Company because of a conflict of interest. He said McKinsey's decision to pay back R650 million of revenue the company made with Regiments was not enough to prove it was the proceeds of large-scale money laundering. READ: I was not a corruption detection machine – Molefe McKinsey’s repayment included work done with Regiments for Transnet and South African Airways and the consultancy said that was because the revenue was tainted. But Molefe said not until the commission said so. The commission asked him about the rise of Regiments after he decided that it should replace Letsema with its takeover of the Nedbank contract to eventually becoming a principal contractor with no tender or vetting.
