Vaccine trial co-lead professor Linda-Gail Bekker on Sunday said: “One would’ve loved to have vaccinated many more people by this time, but I think given the supply and the constraints to supply, I think it has gone exceptionally well.” READ: How does the Johnson & Johnson vaccine compare to others? Bekker said officials were keeping a close eye on the rollout program: “We’ve seen reports of reactogenicity, which are of course expected.

We’ve had no cases of anaphylaxis, but we continue to monitor this very carefully.” WATCH: People infected with 501Y.V2 variant are protected from past and current variants  Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android device.
