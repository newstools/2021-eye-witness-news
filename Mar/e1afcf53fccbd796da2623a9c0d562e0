The South African Council of Churches' Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana said a task team would explore methods of ramping up compliance before making its case to the government. "If we're able to commit to this, we believe we will be able to have a sustainable, non-infectious environment with a less risk."

"Regular worship has not been, in recent months, the source of infection. What has been the source is having funerals, and as for funerals even then it's not the actual service so much but it is the things that happen around it." Mpumlwana is hoping the government will at the very least, relax restrictions for Easter services. “I'm not going to say we are asking for a permanent solution, I'm going to say that we are currently focused on how to make sure that we can safely celebrate Easter, and we can assess the situation."
