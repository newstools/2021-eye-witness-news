JOHANNESBURG – The manager of the Collins Chabane Municipality Tsakani Ngobeni has been granted R50,000 bail by the Palm Ridge Court on Friday. Ngobeni is charged with corruption for allegedly approving a R120 million deposit with VBS Mutual Bank. Meanwhile, demonstrators dressed in Peter Mokaba region regalia have gathered outside the court following reports that reinstated leader Danny Msiza was also expected to be charged. Ngobeni has been added to the seven previously accused persons that include board members and executives of VBS.
