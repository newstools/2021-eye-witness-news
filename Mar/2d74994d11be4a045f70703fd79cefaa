JOHANNESBURG - The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has called on the African National Congress (ANC)’s national executive committee (NEC) to reprimand the party’s top six for instructing its Members of Parliament (MPs) to vote in favour of a parliamentary motion brought forward by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to launch an inquiry into Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. The motion succeeded last week in spite of reservations expressed by ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, who described it as voting with the enemy.

The MKMVA, through a statement, said that the ANC’s top officials enforced the wrong decision on its MPs, calling for the NEC – which is the party’s highest decision-making body in between conferences – to instruct all ANC MPs to never vote along with the DA in future motions it tables in the National Assembly.

He said that there must be clarity: "Both with regards to procedures and principles, the current confusion cannot be allowed to continue. It causes discord within the ANC and also undermines our stature in the eyes of the general South African population." Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
