To his followers, he was "Isilo Samabandla" or King of kings. The salutation, bayede or your majesty, was only reserved for him within the Zulu nation. But the late monarch was equally criticised for comments he made against members of the LGBTI community and foreign nationals. But his supporters there in Nongoma have slammed critics of the king, saying he must be left alone as he was no longer able to defend himself. The late monarch married at least six times during his lifetime. He passed away aged 72, having fathered 28 children.
