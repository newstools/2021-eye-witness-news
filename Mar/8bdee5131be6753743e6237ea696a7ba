JOHANNESBURG – A group of South Africans, which include prominent African National Congress (ANC) veterans,  on Thursday called on the public to help vigorously defend the Constitution in light of former President Jacob Zuma's recent defiance. Religious and business leaders, civil society organisations as well as politicians are among more than 300 people under the campaign ‘Defend our Democracy’ who raised concerns about the state's increasing inability to protect citizens. The campaign also voiced worries that governance had been severely tested over the last few years almost to breaking point. The Defend our Democracy group has lashed out at the former president for defying the Constitutional Court's order that he appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry to give his side of the state capture story.

The group said Zuma was openly attacking the country's democracy.
