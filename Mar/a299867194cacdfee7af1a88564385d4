He previously served as the DA's deputy leader in KwaZulu-Natal. He said his priority is to tackle local government issues in the province. “If we continue to allow the ANC-led municipalities and the IFP-led municipalities to continue to fail in service delivery, there is going to be nothing left for us as a province.” Rodgers has commended outgoing leader Zwakele Mncwango saying he led the party with distinction over the past six years.
