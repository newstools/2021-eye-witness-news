CFO Carmen le Grange told MPs that Denel was struggling to pay severance packages as part of the restructuring process. "We continue to have an issue in terms of the salaries and our ability to pay the full amount of salaries every month. We have also lost a number of critically skilled in some of our key divisions. We have started a Section 189 process in terms of restructuring that was approved by the board, however, we have continued to have a lack of funds to pay severance packages."
