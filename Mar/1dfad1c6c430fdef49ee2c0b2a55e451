CAPE TOWN - A Northern Cape mother and her three children have been taken to a place of safety while the stepfather's been arrested on allegations of sexual and emotional abuse. Police were alerted by a member of the family earlier this month. The woman and three children were allegedly also being held at a Keimoes farm against their will by the man. When officers arrived at the house, they arrested the man and seized an illegal firearm and ammunition. He allegedly sexually abused a 15-year-old girl. Several weeks ago, Police Minister Bheki Cele released quarterly crime statistics  which revealed a bleak picture showing that 12,200 women were raped between October and December last year, with KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape accounting for the highest incidents of rape. The statistics showed how sexual offences increased by 5% compared to the previous period. While delivering that report, the minister also conceded that members of the SAPS were not fully equipped to handle reports of gender-based violence.
