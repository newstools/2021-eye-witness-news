JOHANNESBURG - The Solidarity Fund said that of the R3.22 billion received from donors so far, R2.76 billion had been allocated across the three pillars driving its work. The fund, which has been in existence for a year now, has enjoyed support from political parties, the private sector and the international community, among others. It has been a year since the Solidarity Fund was established to raise much-needed funds to support the country’s COVID-19  mitigation strategies and it's already bearing fruit.

This was likely attributed to the UK donation of R81 million” said the fund's CEO Thandi Nzimande.
