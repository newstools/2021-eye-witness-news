JOHANNESBURG - Investment into a Cape Winelands airport holds huge benefits for the local economy. That's according to Western Cape trade and investment agency, Wesgro. The owners of the airport want to develop a Lanseria-type facility in the Durbanville area of Cape Town. Wesgro CEO Tim Harris was excited by the prospect of a developed Cape Winelands airport. He said that the agency had been in talks with the airport for months. "We're working to make this happen because I think any major city reaches a point where they need a second airport. Cape Wineland's airport is very strategically situated and it has a lot of elements you'd look for in an airport." Harris said that having a second airport in Cape Town would boost the local economy and provide sustainable jobs. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.
