JOHANNESBURG - Long-serving South African Revenue Service (Sars) official Vlok Symington has described the years under former Commissioner Tom Moyane as “a nightmare”. He said that Sars was modernised and built up after 1994 to become recognised as one of the world’s most efficient tax administrations, but that under Moyane’s tenure of fewer than four years, this efficiency diminished. Symington, who has worked for Sars since 1990, was concluding his testimony before deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo at the state capture inquiry. Vlok Symington served at Sars when it was still known as inland revenue and was there when it was taken in a new direction by then-commissioner Pravin Gordhan, achieving global recognition for its efficiency.

But after Tom Moyane became commissioner, Sars executives were presented with a new model for the agency, designed by Bain & Company, as a fait accompli.

Symington lamented what Sars went through. "To then see this happening to Sars, in a very short space of time – from 2014 – it was less than four years, where we could visibly see that our efficiency rate has dropped." Symington told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo: "I just hope, chair, that this will never happen again and I think that your commission is instrumental in ensuring that it won’t ever happen again."
